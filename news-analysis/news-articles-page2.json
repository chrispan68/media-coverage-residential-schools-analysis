            "content": "I\u2019ve almost forgotten how to drive. From March 2020 until vaccination, I rarely left my neighborhood. Every week or two, I took my car around the block to keep the battery charged. When the lease ended in October, my wife and I decided we would share a single car.\n\nNow that Los Angeles is reopening, I\u2019ve been using that car a bit more, but I\u2019m hard-pressed to access my own internal routes and shortcuts, the mind maps that all Angelenos develop. I used to know how to get around automatically \u2014 when to drive local streets rather than the freeways, where and when I\u2019d find a shady parking space.\n\nI can still operate a vehicle, but that other stuff, the intuitive ebb and flow of moving through Los Angeles \u2014 I can\u2019t take it for granted anymore. Recently, going from Mid-City to Little Tokyo, I got mired in traffic on Olympic, forgetting entirely my favorite east-west alternative, James M. Wood Boulevard.\n\nThis is an inconvenience, but it\u2019s less a problem than an opportunity. What I mean is that I\u2019m experiencing Los Angeles anew, relearning it. Like all of us, I am being presented with the chance to reimagine the city and the way I live in it.\n\nAnd why not? Do we really want to return to the way we were prior to the pandemic? I know that I do not. I agree with Brian Taylor, director of UCLA\u2019s Institute of Transportation Studies, who in June posed the big traffic question: Will we \u201cresort back\u201d to our old living patterns? If we do, he said, we\u2019ll also go back to getting nowhere fast.\n\nIn this moment of transition, then, I\u2019d like to suggest a frame of reference that I found useful during lockdown: keeping the city small.\n\nFor me, this means walking. During the pandemic, I tried to do it daily. It was my recreation, my way to participate in the city as a public space even when the streets were nearly empty.\n\nLos Angeles is not a walking city. But what if we behaved as if it were?\n\nWalking roots us. It connects us to our surroundings; it fosters intimacy because it requires that we be present, paying attention here and now. When you walk, you aren\u2019t moving fast or far enough to lose track of where you\u2019re going.\n\nWalking the same streets every day, I see the same people, my neighbors. Whether or not we know each other, we nod or say hello. There are ways to encourage this level of connectedness even in a city as far-flung as Los Angeles. There are pandemic innovations we ought to keep.\n\nSlow Streets L.A. is one example. This program, developed to encourage pedestrianism and safe outdoor interaction during lockdown, was inaugurated in May 2020 to mitigate the closure of parks and hiking trails. It uses barriers to discourage automobile traffic and encompasses 50 miles of streets in 30 neighborhoods.\n\nMuch like allowing restaurants to take over parking lanes for outdoor dining, Slow Streets L.A. should be judiciously expanded and made permanent to affirm that every street is shared space.\n\nEven before COVID-19, Los Angeles was attempting a transition from cars and freeways to a more varied cityscape. Light rail, denser and more affordable housing, increased emphasis on neighborhoods where at least some of what you need is close by. These are the building blocks of a city that aspires to be humane.\n\nShifting physical infrastructure from fast to slower is just one kind of connection the last year and a half has encouraged. In late 2019, just a month or so before the coronavirus was detected, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti convened what he called the Civic Memory Working Group. (Full disclosure: I was a member.) The pandemic pushed a lot of people to look back as a way of thinking about how to move forward. Especially after the George Floyd protests, the working group sought to do that on a larger basis.\n\nThe group\u2019s recommendations include establishing a city historian\u2019s office, renewing attention to Indigenous narratives and rethinking the city\u2019s monuments in order to reframe its \u201cdifficult histories.\u201d For instance, the Chinese Massacre of 1871, which we should acknowledge, 150 years later, on Oct. 24.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake is how we understand place, how it tells us who we are. If the pandemic has had a silver lining, it is that it makes us think hard about our relationships to one another and the city itself. We have made the city small because we had to. Now we can keep it small \u2014 connected and self-reflective, emphasizing a human landscape \u2014 by choice.\n\nSo far, my own slowdown has kept me walking. Driving less means seeing more closely, as well as saving energy, time and money. At the same time, I\u2019m working on my workarounds, how to get to downtown or to Silver Lake or Palms or Venice using muscle memory (even if I think twice before making the trip).\n\nAt some point, my old internal maps will kick back in. When they do, I hope Los Angeles will have embraced the opportunities disruption has presented. Let\u2019s keep the city small.",

            "description": "Assam-Mizoram Border Clash Leaves at Least 5 Dead  The New York Times",
            "content": "A standoff near a long-disputed state border of Mizoram and Assam in India left at least five police officers from Assam dead, and dozens of civilians and other officers injured.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTwo Indian states have been arguing since the 1980s over where exactly the line falls on a 193-square-mile strip of land dividing them. On Monday, guns and hand grenades came out.\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Gunfire and grenades exploded along a stretch of dense tropical forest in India\u2019s northeast on Monday in a standoff involving hundreds of police and civilians over a long-disputed state border crossing. At least five police officers from the state of Assam were killed and dozens of officers and civilians were injured in the melee, which took place in the small village of Vairengte in the Kolasib district of the far northeastern state of Mizoram. Mizoram and Assam officials quickly blamed each other for the bloodshed. The flare-up over the disputed territory was the first involving casualties in decades, experts said, and raised broader questions about India\u2019s ruling party, Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. The clash occurred two days after Amit Shah, India\u2019s powerful home minister, and a member of the party, held a meeting with state leaders meant to resolve the border dispute there and some elsewhere in India\u2019s northeast.\n\nThough Assam is led by the B.J.P. and Mizoram by a regional party in coalition with the B.J.P., the talks with Mr. Shah appeared not to defuse tensions, as the fighting Monday made all too clear. Leaders of the Congress party, the main opposition to the B.J.P., pointed to the government\u2019s failure to negotiate a peaceful solution as evidence of its ineffectiveness. Even observers outside the political fray said two state police forces shooting at one another raised serious issues. \u201cThis should have been sorted out much before by the home ministry, but somehow it has not happened \u2014 and this is the repercussion,\u201d said Bhagat Oinam, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Boundary disputes between Mizoram and Assam are not new. The two sides have argued where exactly the line falls on a 193-square-mile strip of land since the 1980s, when Mizoram and three other Indian states were carved out of Assam, a sprawling state that borders Bhutan and Bangladesh.\n\nThe states were created in accords drawn with the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in an attempt to broker a solution to years of rebel insurgency by groups seeking independence from India. Several of Assam\u2019s borders with other states are also disputed. The episode began Monday morning, when police officers from Assam state seized a newly constructed Mizoram police post, according to Mizoram officials. The Assam police said that the post was illegal because it fell within Assam\u2019s borders, and that troops had taken it over in protest. After the Assam police seized the Mizoram police post, officials from both sides tried to ease tensions. But by Monday afternoon, hundreds of people, many Indigenous Mizo, from villages on the outskirts of the Singla Forest Reserve had joined the standoff, throwing stones and firing guns. At the same time, Himanta Biswa Sarma, the chief minister of Assam, and Zoramthanga, the chief minister of Mizoram, traded barbs on social media, tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s office and Mr. Shah. \u201cAssam police used cane charging and tear gas smoke,\u201d Vanlalfaka Ralte, the Kolasib district police chief, said. \u201cAssam side started firing on the Mizoram side,\u201d Mr. Ralte said, \u201cThen my troops replied.\u201d The Assam police had a different account. They said after they seized the post, Mizo civilians attacked them. Afterward, Assam police officials said, Mizoram police opened fire on Assam police and civilians using automatic weapons including light machine guns, which are used in military combat.\n\nThat account was repeated by Sushmita Dev, a member of the Congress party and a former member of Parliament from Assam. \u201cIt is the civilians of Mizoram who came out of the forest with weapons like slings,\u201d Ms. Dev said. \u201cThey created tensions. Behind civilians there were Mizoram police on standby. They say that this is public outrage about land.\u201d Whatever preceded the violence, the Assam police were said to have borne the brunt of it. The episode left five of them dead and perhaps 50 injured, including a district-level officer from Assam\u2019s Cachar district. On the Mizoram side, two police officers and seven local residents were injured, according to Mr. Ralte. The Central Reserve Police Force, controlled by the Indian government in New Delhi, was deployed to the area, where an uneasy peace had been restored on Tuesday. Last year, residents of Assam and Mizoram clashed twice in the space of a week over disputed territory, resulting in at least eight people injured and several homes and shops burned to the ground. In one episode, a Mizoram betel nut plantation was set on fire. In another, people from Assam pelted the Mizoram police and residents with stones. \u201cIn turn, Mizoram residents mobilized and went after them,\u201d H. Lalthangliana, a Mizoram district-level official, told reporters.",

            "description": "Legends Remade: New Science Fiction and Fantasy  The New York Times",
            "content": "Marissa Levien\u2019s THE WORLD GIVES WAY (Redhook, 402 pp., $28) is a staggering marvel, an action-packed cat-and-mouse chase on a doomed generation ship the size of Switzerland. Myrra Dal is a contract worker, one of thousands of people serving out indentures signed by their great-grandparents in exchange for passage off a dying Earth. To her, and to most of the other citizens descended from those first passengers, the ship is the world: It has a sky, cities, weather, climates, a desert and a sea. It also has a crack in its hull \u2014 widening, irreparable and kept secret by its wealthiest families \u2014 and 50 years remaining in its 200-year voyage.\n\nA different novel would have concerned itself with a tense race to fix the ship and save humanity, or framed a series of impossible choices about who gets to live or die. But \u201cThe World Gives Way\u201d is neither Tom Godwin\u2019s \u201cThe Cold Equations\u201d nor an episode of \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d and Levien\u2019s breathtaking tale is instead about grace, love and what matters at the end of all things. The book has three points of view: Myrra, on the run after her employers die by suicide, but still caring for their infant daughter; Tobias, the rookie detective pursuing her; and an omniscient voice calmly explaining how the ship\u2019s different biomes will be obliterated as the world gives way. The result is overwhelming, as if the book itself is disintegrating as you read it; hammering throughout like a heartbeat is the question of whether anyone will escape before the end.\n\nNghi Vo\u2019s THE CHOSEN AND THE BEAUTIFUL (Tor.com, 262 pp., $26.99) is a retelling of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d from the point of view of Jordan Baker, in a Jazz Age subtly interwoven with magic and demons. While the plot follows Fitzgerald\u2019s original, there are some key transformations. Baker is Vietnamese, adopted (or abducted) by a wealthy white missionary who died shortly after bringing her to Louisville, and possesses a kind of illusory magic: She can create simulacra of living things by cutting out their silhouettes in paper. Living in precarious affluence, surrounded by money to which she has no claim, Baker nurses a pragmatic cynicism that stands as a mesmerizing inversion of Nick Carraway\u2019s narration. Where Nick observed Jay Gatsby, Jordan observes Daisy Buchanan, illuminating her personality in ways that intersect with and expand Fitzgerald\u2019s portrayal.\n\n\u201cThe Chosen and the Beautiful\u201d deserves to be read as closely as the book that inspired it. Vo\u2019s prose is beautifully supple, and the novel shines when she reads \u201cGatsby\u201d against the grain: The first page transforms one of Fitzgerald\u2019s metaphors about women in summer into a captivating intimacy between Jordan and Daisy, and the whole of Chapter 4 is a stunning play on Fitzgerald\u2019s use of the word \u201ccareless.\u201d The novel falters, though, when integrating fantasy more generally: It\u2019s such a tight reversal of its original\u2019s core dynamics that there isn\u2019t room for the fantastic elements to do more than gild the story\u2019s lily. They only echo, diminished and indistinct, the tensions Vo\u2019s already playing with to good effect, obstructing each other where they should blend, like a cocktail made with fine spirits but mixed in awkward proportions. Despite that, the book remains a sumptuous, decadent read. SWORD STONE TABLE: Old Legends, New Voices (Vintage, 465 pp., paper, $17) is also a book of retellings and transformations. Splendidly edited by Swapna Krishna and Jenn Northington, the anthology builds a kaleidoscope of Arthurian mythography organized into temporal sections \u2014 \u201cOnce\u201d for stories set in the mythic past, \u201cPresent\u201d for more recently historical and contemporary stories, and \u201cFuture\u201d for, well, futuristic science fiction. The pieces are dazzlingly different while overlapping and interweaving like chain mail.\n\nArthurian tradition consists of almost 10 centuries of reinventions and reimaginings across various polities. Sexual and ethnic diversities are already embedded in the canon, as well as wildly disparate takes on any given character; whether King Arthur was the best king ever or a Herod who murdered children depends on which parts of Malory\u2019s \u201cLe Morte d\u2019Arthur\u201d you read. You don\u2019t need to be familiar with the breadth of Arthuriana to enjoy \u201cSword Stone Table,\u201d but it\u2019s a real pleasure, if you\u2019re an Arthur nerd, to pick out which facets of the prism the authors are shining their own lights through.\n\nNo story here is less than solid, but standouts for me included Ausma Zehanat Khan\u2019s \u201cThe Once and Future Qadi,\u201d in which King Arthur summons a Cordoban judge to Camelot to determine whether Guinevere is guilty of adultery; Maria Dahvana Headley\u2019s extraordinary \u201cMayday,\u201d which assembles 19th-century artifacts surrounding the \u201cpresidential run of one Mr. Arthur Pendragon, the Cleveland-based millionaire\u201d with a dark secret past; Waubgeshig Rice\u2019s profoundly moving \u201cHeartbeat,\u201d in which an Indigenous community\u2019s once and future kinship is not so much pulled from a stone as unearthed from beneath it; and Silvia Moreno-Garcia\u2019s \u201cA Shadow in Amber,\u201d which sets \u201cThe Lady of Shalott\u201d in a near-future Mexico City where the young and poor can sell portions of their experiences to the wealthy. If you got excited about Dev Patel starring in \u201cThe Green Knight,\u201d you\u2019ll definitely want to pick this up.",

SWORD STONE TABLE: Old Legends, New Voices (Vintage, 465 pp., paper, $17) is also a book of retellings and transformations. Sexual and ethnic diversities are already embedded in the canon, as well as wildly disparate takes on any given character; whether King Arthur was the best king ever or a Herod who murdered children depends on which parts of Malory\u2019s \u201cLe Morte d\u2019Arthur\u201d you read. \n\nNo story here is less than solid, but standouts for me included Ausma Zehanat Khan\u2019s \u201cThe Once and Future Qadi,\u201d in which King Arthur summons a Cordoban judge to Camelot to determine whether Guinevere is guilty of adultery; Maria Dahvana Headley\u2019s extraordinary \u201cMayday,\u201d which assembles 19th-century artifacts surrounding the \u201cpresidential run of one Mr. Arthur Pendragon, the Cleveland-based millionaire\u201d with a dark secret past; Waubgeshig Rice\u2019s profoundly moving \u201cHeartbeat,\u201d in which an Indigenous community\u2019s once and future kinship is not so much pulled from a stone as unearthed from beneath it; and Silvia Moreno-Garcia\u2019s \u201cA Shadow in Amber,\u201d which sets \u201cThe Lady of Shalott\u201d in a near-future Mexico City where the young and poor can sell portions of their experiences to the wealthy.",

            "description": "Carmen Maria Machado: Banning My Book Won't Protect Your Child  The New York Times",
            "content": "When I was in my early 20s, I was in an abusive relationship with another woman. Soon after it ended, I did what I always did when I was heartbroken: I looked for art that spoke to my experience. I was surprised to find shockingly few memoirs of domestic violence or verbal, psychological and emotional abuse in queer relationships. So I wrote into that silence: a memoir, \u201cIn the Dream House,\u201d which describes that relationship and my struggle to leave it. This year, a parent in Leander, Texas \u2014 livid that \u201cIn the Dream House\u201d appeared on high school classes\u2019 recommended reading lists \u2014 took a pink strap-on dildo to a school board meeting. Voice trembling with disgust, she read excerpts from my book \u2014 including one where I referred to a dildo, inspiring the prop \u2014 before arguing that letting a student read my book could be considered child abuse. She and the other parents like her demanded the removal of my book and several others from district reading lists for high school English class book clubs, from which students were allowed to select one of 15 titles. The school board ultimately decided to remove a number of books, including \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d and a graphic novel version of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and is currently considering whether it should remove more, including mine. I have teamed up with Margaret Atwood, Jodi Picoult, Jacqueline Woodson and many other authors whose works have been targeted for removal from class reading lists in Leander. In conjunction with PEN America, a group that promotes free literary expression, we wrote a letter to the school district demanding that our books remain available to students. While our books may contain passages that are potentially uncomfortable, challenging or even offensive, exposure to our books is vital to expanding minds, affirming experiences, creating appreciation for the arts and building empathy \u2014 in short, respecting the adults that the students in Leander, Texas, will soon become.\n\nSchools rarely provide education about relationships. Teenagers aren\u2019t often taught that extreme jealousy is not romantic but is a sign of an unhealthy relationship. The sections of my book read aloud by the outraged parent in that meeting are part of a larger story, examining what it means to be so head over heels in love, in lust or both that you let someone treat you badly. It was painful and difficult to recount that experience for my book, to lay plain my vulnerabilities and dark moments. But I\u2019m glad I did it. Now that it\u2019s out in the world, I receive easily a dozen messages a week from readers. They thank me; they open up to me; they describe the life-changing experience of feeling seen. People have told me my book gave them the clarity and strength to leave an unhealthy relationship. Book bans in America are nothing new. As long as there have been writers, there have been reactionaries at their heels. (Boston held its first book burning in 1650.) Today in the United States, books that feature characters who are Black, Latinx, Indigenous, queer or trans \u2014 or are written by authors who identify that way \u2014 frequently make up a majority of the American Library Association\u2019s annual list of the top 10 books most often censored in libraries and schools. These book bans deprive students of a better understanding of themselves and one another. As a writer, I believe in the power of words to cross boundaries at a time of deep division. Now more than ever, literature matters. Those who seek to ban my book and others like it are trying to exploit fear \u2014 fear about the realities that books like mine expose, fear about desire and sex and love \u2014 and distort it into something ugly, in an attempt to wish away queer experiences. They do not try to hide their contempt, or their homophobia. They accuse teachers who want to assign my book of \u201cgrooming\u201d students, language that\u2019s often used to accuse someone of being a pedophile and a common conservative dog whistle when it comes to queer art. They want to shield their children from anything that suggests a world beyond their narrow perception.\n\nAs anyone can tell you \u2014 as history can tell you \u2014 this is ultimately a fool\u2019s errand. Ideas don\u2019t disappear when they\u2019re challenged; banned books have a funny way of enduring. But that doesn\u2019t mean these efforts are without consequences. The high school seniors affected by this action are on the cusp of adulthood, if not already there. Soon, they will go into the world. They will date and fall in love and begin relationships, good and bad. I understand that for a parent, it\u2019s almost unthinkable to imagine that your child could experience such trauma. But preventing children from reading my book, or any book, won\u2019t protect them. On the contrary, it may rob them of ways to understand the world they\u2019ll encounter, or even the lives they\u2019re already living. You can\u2019t recognize what you\u2019ve never been taught to see. You can\u2019t put language to something for which you\u2019ve been given no language. Why do we not see these acts of censorship for what they are: shortsighted, violent and unforgivable?

            "description": "Genius Simplicity. \u2018Keith Haring: Radiant Vision\u2019 At Fenimore Art Museum In Cooperstown, NY  Forbes",
            "content": "If Keith Haring\u2019s featureless outlined figures, \u201cradiant baby\u201d and symbols didn\u2019t profoundly address the universal, if they lacked the meaning and soul and inspiration which has defined timeless art since cave drawings, his work would be relegated to the category of mere 80s nostalgia. Mr. T. Tiffany. The Pontiac Fiero.\n\nHaring\u2019s drawings, however, remain universal. They remain timeless. They are brilliant, in their own, unique way, and the best opportunity to see them now comes at the stately Fennimore Art Museum on the shores of bucolic Otsego Lake in charming Cooperstown, NY, a distinct contrast from the grimy, sweaty, late 1970s, early 1980s, New York City where Haring came to international prominence.\n\nLike countless others during that period, Haring was swept up in the city\u2019s emerging youth street culture. Graffiti, breakdancing, Hip-Hop. He broke away from the pack by spreading his playful, freehand, white chalk drawings throughout the subway system on black paper covering unused advertisement space. Working fast, over a period of years, he drew hundreds. They were seen by millions.\n\n\u201cPolice would arrest him, but they couldn't charge him because he wasn't vandalizing anything,\u201d Christine Rossi, Director of Exhibitions at the Fenimore Art Museum which displays \u201cKeith Haring: Radiant Vision,\u201d through September 6 told Forbes.com.\n\nThe city was waging a war on graffiti during this period, turning taggers into outlaws. Michael Stewart notoriously died in police custody following his arrest for writing on a subway wall.\n\nPerhaps it was his baby face. Maybe the glasses. Painting in the subway, but not on the trains. Being white definitely helped. As did the innocence of his images. Haring never acquired the \u201cvillain\u201d label and was soon an emerging art world darling, befriended by Andy Warhol, invited to the most fashionable clubs.\n\nHaring, it seems, was just too nice, too outwardly innocent, his drawing too joyful to be considered threatening. Don\u2019t be confused by this into thinking the work was pablum.\n\n\u201cEven when he's dealing with very difficult topics, there\u2019s this joy of living that you feel in his work, a value for living and for other people and for dignity, so, the pieces can be difficult, but they're also uplifting in that way,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nHis Crack is Wack mural on a handball court along FDR Drive created in 1986 is still there. His 1985 Free South Africa lithograph with a small white figure lassoing the neck of a large black figure, then being stepped on, may be the most widely disseminated activist art image in history. Innumerable posters raising awareness about AIDS and compassion for its sufferers placed him at the forefront of that movement. He would succumb to complications related to the disease in 1990 at 31-years-old.\n\n\u201cSomehow, he found a way to take the spirit of graffiti art, but also bring it around so that it was accessible to more people and incorporate often a social justice aspect to whatever he was doing that brought it to another level,\u201d Rossi, who saw Haring\u2019s work on the streets while living in New York during the time, said.\n\nAccessibility was one feature of Haring\u2019s genius.\n\nAs was his line.\n\nAll of his drawings\u2013from a poster in the subway to a 50-foot mural\u2013were invented on the spot without an underdrawing or preparatory sketch. In any Keith Haring artwork, there was never a plan going in. He started and allowed his mind and the line to take him where it would. Astonishing.\n\nWhat did not derive from inherit genius, but rather careful study, were his symbols.\n\n\u201cHaring studied the topic of semiotics, how meaning is attached to shapes and symbols, and he also looked at earlier artwork in different cultures to draw from,\u201d Rossi explains. \u201cHe looked at ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and you'll see that in his artwork\u2013pyramids, and Anubis, the dog-headed god of the dead\u2013and because he's tapping into this universal language, images that maybe people have seen, very simple, like pictographs\u2013everybody speaks this language\u2013it\u2019s a visual language that everyone can access.\u201d\n\nIn the gallery next to \u201cRadiant Vision,\u201d the Fennimore has an exhibition of Native American art from its exemplary permanent collection of indigenous work.\n\n\u201cWe put that exhibit in there purposely to examine the different geometric patterns, the symbols, the motifs that are repeated again and again in our Native American objects that are just a sort of thing that Haring was looking at,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nIn using these basic shapes and forms, what seems rudimentary, was actually intentionally accessible. Haring used simplicity as a tool. The genius making the complex uncomplicated.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful thing about Haring\u2019s work is you can read into them; he creates this universal visual language and then you bring to it what you will,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nFeaturing more than 100 works from a private collection, \u201cRadiant Vision\u201d includes lithographs, silkscreens, drawings on paper, and posters, and details the full arc of Haring's short, but prolific career. The show examines different aspects of Haring\u2019s life and career including his subway drawings and street art, gallery shows, the Pop Shop, and his commercial work.\n\nIn its entirety, the exhibition serves as a tribute to this iconic artist and his dedication to social justice and the betterment of youth worldwide. And his permanence as more than a shooting star of contemporary art, an essential to global Popular culture.\n\n\u201c(In) tackling subjects that are still with us today\u2013social justice, ideas about equality, dignity, love is love\u2013they're still with us and so I think the work is still very relevant and very powerful,\u201d Rossi said.",

            "description": "6 Steps To Build A Successful DE&I Strategy From Scratch  Forbes",
            "content": "Everyone is talking about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) \u2013 but why is it so important?\n\nDiverse, fair and inclusive cultures foster connections, increase acceptance and tolerance, create trust and improve morale. All of these are important and beneficial in their own right. But an effective DE&I strategy also improves a business\u2019 bottom line.\n\nDiverse workforces lead to diversity of thought, greater innovation and better business outcomes. How can we create products and services for a multifaceted and complex society with a homogenous workforce which isn\u2019t reflective of buyers? A 2017 study by McKinsey found the most diverse organisations outperform competitors by 33% and are 21% more likely to experience above average profitability. Decision making by diverse teams delivers better outcomes than that of individuals 87% of the time.\n\nHow can organisations move the needle on their DE&I initiatives?\n\nBe deliberate and purposeful. Set clear DE&I targets and measure your progress against them. For many organisations, doing this successfully requires improving the capture, storage and protection of data. Support the business with resources and training to increase awareness and help remove bias from talent pooling and the assessment process.\n\nA lot of bias plays out subconsciously, and even when individuals come to the table fully embracing the right attitudes around DE&I, bias is inherent. Set expectations around the behaviours you need to see from the recruiter and hiring manager into policy. For example: every talent pool should have 50:50 split in terms of gender as a basic starting point.\n\nUse internal mobility and alumni to increase diversity\n\nThis may seem counter-intuitive. If you're only hiring from within the company or using alumni, doesn\u2019t this increase the likelihood of creating a homogenous workforce, making it harder to move the needle on DE&I?\n\nIn speaking with HR leaders, many have raised the challenge of increasing diversity within certain departments (e.g finance, IT and HR). There is an opportunity to build diverse teams by moving current employees across departments.\n\nOrganisations have achieved this through candid and honest discussions with business leaders and hiring managers to understand the skills and behaviours needed to ensure quality of hire (rather than focusing on experience). Equally important is ensuring employees know the roles are available, understand the requirements and are encouraged and supported to apply for internal positions.\n\nThis is harder than it sounds. Studies have shown that hiring someone who is a good cultural fit increases team productivity, job satisfaction, and employee retention which is why hiring managers are so keen on it. But if there\u2019s no clear definition of what makes a candidate a good cultural fit there\u2019s a tendency to hire people similar to yourself. This limits diversity in the workplace. Some organisations are now looking for culture-add. Instead of asking \u201care they a good cultural fit?\u201d ask \u201chow can they enrich our existing team culture?\u201d\n\nConsider the order of candidates\n\nDid you know the order in which candidates are presented can influence your impression of them? The first candidate may benefit from what is called primacy bias \u2013 when listening to a series of informational inputs you remember, or more easily recall, the information you heard first. Whereas the last candidate may benefit from recency bias \u2013 you remember what you heard most recently. The attributes of the middle candidates are more likely to blur together.\n\nStrategies to help counter this include ensuring candidates are assessed against relevant criteria, taking notes and ideally having two interviewers present. Relying on memory alone is tricky. Order of candidates is something to take into consideration as you aim to improve your diversity targets. In speaking with HR leaders aiming to improve gender diversity, placing female candidates first in the assessment process has positively influenced outcomes.\n\nKnow where and how to target diverse talent\n\nAre your sourcing efforts allowing you to tap into and attract a diverse and talented workforce? Consider your sourcing channels \u2013 they are instrumental to helping achieve your goals.\n\nCompanies which rely heavily on referrals may be inadvertently reducing diversity, as seen in a company I spoke with which had a very male dominated workforce. The heavy reliance on referrals meant they weren\u2019t achieving their diversity quota even at the top of the funnel applicant stage. Another organisation had success through its \u2018family-friendly\u2019 accreditation, which allowed them to post to specific job boards.\n\nJob ads are also important. Create inclusive job descriptions and identify and reduce wording bias (exclusionary terms surrounding gender, age and culture) that may be deterring diverse candidates from applying. . According to a McKinsey study, 39% of candidates reject a role or do not proceed with a job application due to a perceived lack of inclusiveness within the organisation. Semantics matters: Organisations have seen a 40% uplift in indigenous applicants by removing biased language and creating targeted job ads.\n\nProactively build diverse talent pools and pipelines, both internally and externally, so you have warm talent at your fingertips. Recruitment Marketing strategies can support organisations to attract, engage and nurture a diverse pool of candidates at-scale. Leading organisations often take the following approach:\n\u2022 Showcase content that is designed to appeal to diverse perspectives with a career site that highlights an organisation\u2019s inclusive employer brand and culture\n\u2022 Build diverse microsites and landing pages that highlight specific DE&I programs or policies\n\u2022 Grow and nurture diverse talent communities with targeted campaigns and nurture flows\n\nFor all initiatives put in place, remember to measure against your initial targets, then track and adjust to ensure you\u2019re getting the most value out of your DE&I strategy.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn",

Bush to Adolph Hitler, who orchestrated the genocide that killed Frank.\n\nThe group also claimed that European Jews \"were financing the slave ships from Africa to the [A]mericas\" and \"experimenting upon the Harero people\" with the Germans on \"Shark Island.\"\n\nANNE FRANK MEMORIAL IN US DEFACED WITH SWASTIKA STICKERS\n\nBlack Hammer also claimed in other anti-Semitic tweets that Frank was \"literally amerikan propaganda used to silence colonized people on the harm yt jews are doing today to colonized people,'' followed by a quote from Malcolm X criticizing Jewish people.\n\nThey also referred to Frank \u2014 who died at age 15 in a Nazi concentration camp \u2014 as a \"bleach demon\" and claimed that the proceeds from the sale of her diary fund a genocide against Palestinians.\n\n\"Anne Frank\u2019s father participated in an imperial army that went abroad [and] killed African people everyday, but we\u2019re supposed to cry for the bleach demon,\" the group tweeted. \"What makes it even worse is proceeds of her diary, which was filled in by her father, go towards genocide of Palestinians.\"\n\nThe Black Hammer Organization also responded to the StopAntisemitism.org Twitter account's warning that radicals \"are calling Anne Frank a colonizer.\"\n\nGHOST GUNS, NAZI PARAPHERNALIA, NEARLY $1M IN METH SEIZED AT PENNSYLVANIA HOME\n\n\"For the last time, we unite with colonized Jews, not colonizers!\" the group responded. \"Her father was literally involved in the killing of colonized people, like what is wrong with y'all??\"\n\nThe Black Hammer describes the organization as \"a revolutionary mass organization dedicated toward building a sustainable future for all colonized people worldwide.\"\n\nIn its , the group says its goal is to \"take the Land Back for all colonized people worldwide. We are focused on building dual contending power of and for the colonized masses.\"\n\nTheir is the construction of a commune by the name of Hammer City, which the group is trying to establish through a GoFundMe page aiming to raise $500,000.\n\nBlack Hammer advertises the project as building \"a city for all people of color to be free\" regardless of their \"nationality, gender, age, mental/physical differences\" or other characteristics.\n\nHOME DEPOT BOYCOTT PUSHED BY PASTOR WHO CALLED FARRAKHAN \u2018ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS OF OUR PEOPLE\u2019\n\nAdditionally, the organization promises that the commune will have employment, \"food,\" \"housing,\" and \"healthcare\" in addition to \"[n]o cops, no rent, no Coronavirus, and no white people.\"\n\nAs of this writing, the has raised just above $64,000 and a recent post mirroring a from the organization claimed that Black Hammer \"liberated\" 200 acres of land in \"so-called \u2018Colorado, USA.\u2019\n\n\"Our comrades who had the chance to visit the land sang only praises of the land-how the land is perfect to build our eco-friendly and durable earthbag homes, the beautiful rivers and streams that pass through it, and the amazing flora and fauna we will be living in community with,\" the post reads.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Black Hammer Organization general Secretary Anco Nahuel defended the tweets, claiming the term \"Bleach Demon is inflammatory\" but \"is not a slur.\"\n\n\"We are staunchly anti white and believe all white people have benefited from colonialism,\" he continued. \"We aim to expose how white Jewish (vs say Ethiopian Jews) people despite their historical oppression currently participate in colonialism. (Palestine, Harlem, etc).\"\n\n\"We have no respect for our oppressors and all jokes and insults are 100% okay for the oppressed to use against their oppressor as they do not prevent the right to self determination,\" Nahuel said.\n\nNahuel concluded by saying reporters should find \"something better to report on, like Kamala Harris letting indigenous people get slaughtered at the border\" and \"the peddling of a world war with China by both ruling classes of this so called nation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Black Hammer Organization page, membership \"is exclusive to colonized people only\" who are 18 or older and says in all-caps: \"NO WHITES ALLOWED.\"\n\nMembership levels are defined by infamous communist leaders, including Chinese dictator Mao Ze Dong and communist revolutionary Che Guevara.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThis article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience. On a spring morning, the Vancouver Land Bridge appears to be a bridge alive, lush with native plants fluttering in the wind as joggers follow its wavy path. Its long arc \u2014 about a third of a mile \u2014 weaves and soars over Highway 14, reconnecting the Columbia River with the ancient Klickitat Trail, said to have been used by Northwest tribes for millenniums. Ten miles north of downtown Portland, Ore., the earth-covered pedestrian bridge, completed in 2008, was a collaboration between the architect Johnpaul Jones, best known for his work on the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, and the artist and architect Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Mr. Jones and his architectural firm created the maquette of the land bridge that is the centerpiece of \u201cAlong the Columbia River: Maya Lin and the Confluence Project,\u201d which will be on view through Dec. 15 at Whitman College\u2019s Maxey Museum in Walla Walla, Wash., and online.\n\nUsing architectural models, blueprints, correspondence, interviews, geological surveys and other archival materials, \u201cAlong the Columbia River\u201d is the first retrospective to outline the scope and impact of the Confluence Project, a Washington-Oregon nonprofit that seeks to educate the public about the river system\u2019s significance through the voices of Northwest tribes and to counter the myth that Lewis and Clark \u201cdiscovered\u201d this land. At the land bridge, \u201cWe grabbed the prairie and pulled it over the highway,\u201d Mr. Jones has said.\n\nIt is among six public \u201cart landscapes\u201d the Confluence Project commissioned Ms. Lin to design along 438 miles of the Columbia River system, from the basalt fish-cleaning table engraved with the Chinook creation story at Cape Disappointment State Park on the Washington coast to the story circles at Sacagawea Historical State Park and the Listening Circle amphitheater at Chief Timothy Park on an island in the Snake River near Clarkston, Wash. Each site was chosen by Columbia River tribes to mark a significant confluence, or spot where bodies of water or cultures converge. Five of the six are complete.\n\nMr. Minthorn said the project works to unite a small group of people \u2014 Native Americans \u2014 with their fellow citizens in learning how to \u201cbecome American\u201d and how best to steward the land together. The goal, he said, is to create visual markers, not monuments per se, that are in harmony with the landscape and serve as reminders that \u201cjust because you don\u2019t see us does not mean we are not here.\u201d \u201cThe education of non-Native people about the Indigenous history of this place helps them to become more from this place, and of this place,\u201d Mr. Minthorn said.\n\nThe exhibition also highlights how these projects offer alternative ways of honoring histories and living cultures in a period marked by the toppling of statues and the rejection of celebrated individuals frozen in time and stone. \u201cWe\u2019re responding to a growing hunger to know more about what it means to be from here and to have a better relationship to our environment,\u201d said Colin Fogarty, executive director of the Confluence Project. In April, Whitman and Confluence hosted \u201cAn Evolutionary Moment for Monuments,\u201d a panel discussion for the exhibition. \u201cWe are not monument builders,\u201d explained Bobbie Conner, director of the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute, a Confluence educator and also a member of the tribes of the Umatilla reservation. \u201cWe do not construct edifices or sculptures or obelisks to pay heed to the past. We keep track of the past in our oral histories, in our hearts and in our minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re expecting this great artwork that rises out of the earth or calls attention to itself and screams: \u2018I am a great work of art. Look just at me and don\u2019t look at anything else around me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I find most poignant about the Confluence Project is that it resists that kind of looking. It asks viewers to work harder, and it also calls attention to the landscape around it, and it asks you to move around and experience those sites as whole environments.\u201d The Confluence Project and Ms. Lin do not ignore the roles of Lewis and Clark and other non-Native Americans; rather they use the explorers\u2019 copious documentation as supplementary material, secondary to the primary source of Native voices and oral traditions. The explorers, Mr. Fogarty said, \u201cdidn\u2019t discover this place, but they took really great notes.\u201d The Land Bridge, for example, features panels identifying native plants and how they were used by regional tribes alongside panels about the campsite of Lewis and Clark and the establishment of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s first European trading post, now Fort Vancouver.\n\nAt the Sandy River Delta site, 20 miles east of Portland, Ms. Lin\u2019s elliptical wooden Bird Blind structure is composed of slats engraved with the common and scientific names of the 134 species Lewis and Clark noted in their journey. \u201cMy goal at times was to disappear, not to add an artwork, but my art was to erase prior damage and to restore a connection back to the environment, allowing the visitor a visceral and intimate connection back to the land itself,\u201d Ms. Lin has written of the project. (Another of Ms. Lin\u2019s installations with an environmental theme opened this month in New York City. \u201cGhost Forest,\u201d in Madison Square Park through November, illustrates the effects of climate change on a once-vibrant woodland.)",

            "content": "My great-grandmother, Rebecca Brown Crutcher -- a woman who was the picture of Black excellence -- lived and worked in the Greenwood community. But in 1921, she fled in fear of her life as White Tulsans burned her neighborhood to the ground.\n\nWhat was once the wealthiest Black neighborhood in America became charred ash in a matter of hours. 10,000 Black residents were left homeless -- and an entire generation of Black Tulsans were robbed of their wealth and prosperity they had built. To this day, not one person has ever been held accountable and not a single cent of reparations has been paid to the survivors or the victims' descendants.\n\nWithout this necessary reckoning with the past, we're already repeating it. As Oklahoma and many around the world are preparing to mark the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, last month, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a law criminalizing peaceful protesters and giving immunity to drivers who \"unintentionally'' kill or injure protesters. This law is, according to the count kept by the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law, just one of 81 anti-protest bills introduced in 34 states during the 2021 legislative session alone -- most of them framed as a response to last summer's Black Lives Matter protests. But instead of tackling the root causes of these nationwide protests against police brutality, racism and anti-Blackness, many lawmakers are attempting to intimidate, malign and criminalize peaceful protesters.\n\nLaws like this one will undoubtedly have painful and long-lasting consequences in Oklahoma and the rest of the nation. Black, brown and Indigenous people will surely be locked up, ripped apart from their families, and may lose their jobs for exercising their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble in a protest. They will surely receive harsher punishments for protesting police brutality and racial injustice than, for instance, White protesters demonstrating for gun rights or for their desire to control a woman's body.\n\nThis isn't the only bill introduced in Oklahoma this session that's followed the Tulsa Race Massacre's sinister legacy of suppression and erasure of Black Oklahomans. Half a dozen bills have already been introduced to restrict absentee voting and require identification to vote, echoing the growing trend of voting restrictions around the country . Historically in our state as elsewhere, these tactics have been used to disenfranchise Black and brown, poor and older communities and people with disabilities, with the precedent being set in one state and spreading like wildfire to the rest of the country. On May 7, Governor Stitt signed HB 1775 into law, which will prohibit Oklahoma schools from teaching critical race theory -- or in other words important lessons about systemic racism and diversity. The measure is meant to essentially stifle important discussions about, among other things, the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the Trail of Tears and the Osage murders in classrooms and beyond. Erasing our history, yet again, will have devastating consequences. And Oklahoma isn't alone -- bills banning or restricting the teaching of critical race theory have been drafted in Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and West Virginia and already passed in Utah, Arkansas, Idaho and Tennessee. Bills like HB 1775 attempt to obscure the fact that heinous instances of racial violence, from slavery to Jim Crow laws to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, are not blemishes on our history but consequences of discriminatory systems that continue to harm Black people today. How businesses can heed Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call to support Black banks Such laws are designed to prevent a full and honest accounting of how systemic racism works. The bill says it will prohibit the teaching that \"an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex,\" thereby upholding White supremacy and helping absolve the city of Tulsa and the state of the moral obligation of paying reparations to the survivors and descendants of the Tulsa Race Massacre. HB 1775 also flies in the face of reality -- as if the wealth and security stripped from Black Tulsans a century ago doesn't have a direct relationship to the widening gaps in home ownership, education, life expectancy and arrest rates today. Each of us should learn the hard lessons of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and the continued harm shouldered by the survivors, the descendants and the neighborhood of Greenwood. We should learn that race, racism and discrimination have very real, concrete effects on our history, our culture, our politics and our current lives. But we can't learn the truth or grow from it if it's hidden from us -- and that's precisely what HB 1775 attempts to do. In so doing, this measure continues the harm of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, because a century later, Stitt and our elected officials are still trying to bury the lessons that our ancestors would want us to carry forward. Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook As a descendant of a Tulsa Race Massacre survivor, it's painful to see Oklahoma's governor refuse to learn from our history and acknowledge its continuing impact today. Instead, he's chosen to saddle our teachers and educators with even more baggage, and potentially penalize them for doing what's right. My hope is that our teachers will look this evil in the eye and refuse to give in or back down. I hope they will continue teaching the truth about topics like the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre -- including that it was borne from White supremacy, a mortal threat to our democracy that remains with us today. Our students deserve the unbridled truth, not a polished facade that makes us feel good about ourselves.",

            "content": "Natasha S. Alford, a CNN political analyst, is VP of Digital Content and a senior correspondent at theGrio. Follow her on Twitter or Instagram at @natashasalford . The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) In response to the accusations of colorism in Lin-Manuel Miranda's highly anticipated movie adaptation of \"In The Heights,\" legendary Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno essentially told those objecting to the dearth of dark-skinned Afro-Latinx actors in the cast of the musical to take a seat.\n\n\"I'm simply saying, can't you just wait awhile and leave it alone?\" Moreno told CBS host Stephen Colbert in an interview Wednesday night. \"It would be so nice if they hadn't come up with that and left it alone, just for now. I mean, they're really attacking the wrong person.\"\n\nAfter facing backlash of her own for those comments, Moreno, who once had to darken her own skin for roles, apologized , saying \"I'm incredibly disappointed with myself. While making a statement in defense of Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Colbert Show last night, I was clearly dismissive of Black lives that matter in our Latin community.\"\n\nMoreno's apology doesn't erase the problematic tensions over Latinidad, or \"Latino-ness.\" What's notable is that her initial response never declared that Afro-Latinos didn't have a legitimate complaint -- but that when it came to this larger project of Latinidad , they should nonetheless take a metaphorical seat at the back of the bus. Hold off on disrupting the joy of this beautifully produced musical's moment and fall in line with celebrating the version of Latinx representation that supposedly should be enough. Apparently, displeased Afro-Latinos were, in this formulation, just part of a larger cancel and complaint culture.\n\nMoreno's take not only seemed to dismiss the legitimate critique of Black Latinos and the large population of Afro-Dominicans in Washington Heights, but also echoed a sentiment that is firmly entrenched in many Latinx communities when it comes to any discussion of race: Don't touch it. In listening to Moreno, many of us saw and heard some version of our own family members.\n\nIn places like Puerto Rico, the same island where Moreno is from and my grandmother was born before departing for New York City in the 1950s, there is a great cultural pride and a strong sense of national identity that many expect to supersede issues of race, which are often seen as divisive and counterproductive.\n\nMany Puerto Ricans are told specifically from the day we are born that we are a proud mix of African, indigenous Taino and Spaniard ancestors. As Latinos, we are one big family, and mixture, or mestizaje, is evidence of equal acceptance of all parts of the mix. There is no problem with racism because we are a melting pot. As argued in \"Skin-Color Prejudice and Within-Group Racial Discrimination\" in the Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, \"Mestizaje, an ideology whereby everyone was deemed to be of mixed descent, was one of the main strategies the Spaniards used to deemphasize privileges associated with phenotypically White characteristics.\"\n\nBut statistics and the lived experiences of Afro-Latinos tell a different story about the so-called melting pot. Just like its colonizing owner, the United States, places like Puerto Rico still wrestle with social caste systems that relegate Black Latinos to the bottom and place the lightest and whitest Latinos at the top of the hierarchy. Phrases like pelo malo (bad hair) and \"mejorar la raza\" (improve the race by marrying a White partner) are still used.\n\nThere is an emerging body of research that suggests darker-skinned Latinos are more likely to have poorer health outcomes than lighter-skinned Latinos. They often are erased from mainstream media representation, and when they appear in television and movies they are typically cast as maids, servants or criminals -- if they are cast at all. Afro-Latina beauty queens, such as the Dominican Republic's Clauvid Daly, are subject to racist abuse. Puerto Rican Blackface characters such as Chianita Gobernadora and Pirulo have been applauded on TV by giddy audience members who still find the caricatures of their darker-skinned Afro-Latinos to be comical. Last year in Colombia, five Afro-Colombian teens were tortured and killed after going to fly kites, leading to a national outcry.\n\nAll of this is why it's crucial to understand that the swelling tide of Afro-Latinx voices who are calling out racism and celebrating Black Latino contributions now are part of a larger movement and a continuum that has always existed.\n\nSo when a legendary figure like Rita Moreno tells Afro-Latinos to \"wait\" on calling out their erasure, that a high-profile Hollywood moment for Latinos shouldn't be a moment for them too -- the message to an entire generation is that their fight doesn't matter and that non-Black Latinos must be first to advance for all to advance. Sound familiar? It also implies that Afro-Latinos' desire for representation is trivial, when being visible is part of a larger project of racial justice.\n\nLike critics who didn't want Colin Kaepernick to protest racial injustice during the national anthem but instead in a more \"appropriate\" venue, proponents of the \"wait, this isn't the right moment\" approach are telling Afro-Latinos not to interrupt the harmonious idea of community and just let the music play.\n\nBut the truth is there can be no Latino representation without Afro-Latinos. There is no story of Washington Heights without Black people and Afro-Dominicans of all shades.\n\nTo \"bring Latino-ness\" anywhere as Moreno suggested, Afro-Latinos must be included and welcomed on center stage.",

            "description": "Seeking your climate refuge? Consider this  CNN",
            "content": "In California, many are now considering what only a few years ago was unthinkable: In a time of accelerating fossil-fueled climate impacts, how much longer will we stay? And as ever more human beings are forced to navigate the dual emotions of grief about all we're losing and anxiety about how we keep ourselves and our communities safe, how do we also maintain a focus on stopping the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions that are causing this catastrophe in the first place, and keep it from getting worse?\n\nFirst, if you are considering uprooting your life because of climate change, let that sink in. Let that reality, a scenario that was likely inconceivable to you just a few years ago, radicalize you to the all-encompassing scope, scale and urgency of this existential, all-encompassing crisis.\n\nTake this moment to align your life with this new reality. Become an activist. Get political . Educate yourself and others on the solutions that already exist to address this crisis. If you buy a house, electrify it -- meaning replacing technologies that depend on fossil fuels with ones that use renewable energy. Identify the leverage points you can tap in your life in every sphere of influence -- as an individual, an employee, a community member, a citizen -- to make an outsized impact wherever you can.\n\nAmerica's West is drying out. Here's what we can do about it Process the emotion of it all: that in the year 2021, the climate crisis changed your life personally, fundamentally and permanently. Let the emotion fuel the ferocity of your action. For my family, San Francisco, the place that we loved and built community -- the place where my daughter was born and my son learned to ride a bike -- brought health impacts from smoke that in the end were too much for our set of circumstances. The only useful way that I have managed to deal with that grief is to use it to remind myself and others of the reality of this crisis and all that's at stake. Second, like it or not, you'll represent what the future may hold for whatever town you may choose to move to -- an early warning for communities that have yet to experience the direct and devastating effects of the climate crisis. Use your climate story to sound the alarm to others about the urgency of our unfolding planetary emergency. Don't make this move in silence. Broadcast the reality of it to mobilize everyone you can. Do it loudly. Do it everywhere. Signal the urgency and gravity of the issue through your behavior. Show up at city council meetings. Encourage your city or county to declare a climate emergency. Get involved in local issues -- for me, that means joining the growing community of Water Protectors and allies to oppose the Line 3 pipeline. Focus on deepening community ties and building resilience, because both will be essential elements in an era of chaos and change. Third, ensure that your climate-related move doesn't exacerbate existing inequity. Climate migration risks deepening class divides, disrupting local culture and furthering a history of colonialism. When my family relocated to Duluth, Minnesota, the most valuable advice we received came from Karen Diver , the former tribal leader of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa -- the original caretakers of the place we now call home. \"Don't let your climate solution result in our spiritual and cultural genocide.\" Learn about the history of the land you'll call home. Stand for the rights of indigenous people. Support public programs and community groups. Tread lightly. And remember that climate change is first and foremost a crisis faced by people far less privileged than us. Global warming has been an existential crisis for communities around the world for decades, from Bangladesh to Madagascar , from Syria to the Central Valley; often those who have done the least to contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions but for whom the impacts and implications are far more dire. The ability to worry about or work on climate change is a luxury that many can't afford. Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Ultimately, we'll all realize that there is no such thing as a climate-safe place, only places with different climate-related impacts, unfolding on different timescales, to differently-equipped people, interconnected in ways we can't begin to fathom. I write this from the city that welcomed my family when we left California, (a city that has been called a \" climate safe haven \"), under a red sun setting in an orange sky, as smoke from forest fires in Canada cause unhealthy air quality even here. There is no \"away\" from climate change. Wherever the forest fires are raging, the heat domes are suffocating, the levees are breaking, the famines are starving, the infrastructure is melting, the living things are dying -- it's happening to us all. At this pivotal moment in human and planetary history, the question for us cannot only be, \"Where might I be safe?\" but also, \"Where might I be of most use?\" This is no time for the most privileged among us to insulate ourselves inside our climate havens. This is a time to open our arms wide, contributing and engaging in every way we can to the global effort to reimagine everything about the way we inhabit this planet. A time to find a way, despite the odds, to come back into balance with the earth's exquisitely interconnected -- and still living -- natural systems.",

            "content": "Yale University has restricted access to an online video of a talk given by Dr. Aruna Khilanani, in which she said that talking directly to white people about race was a \u201cwaste of our breath.\u201d\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Yale School of Medicine said the tone and content of a lecture by Dr. Aruna Khilanani, who has a private practice in New York, were \u201cantithetical to the values of the school.\u201d\n\nA psychiatrist said in a lecture at Yale University\u2019s School of Medicine that she had fantasies of shooting white people, prompting the university to later restrict online access to her expletive-filled talk, which it said was \u201cantithetical to the values of the school.\u201d The talk, titled \u201cThe Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind,\u201d had been presented by the School of Medicine\u2019s Child Study Center as part of Grand Rounds, a weekly forum for faculty and staff members and others affiliated with Yale to learn about various aspects of mental health. In the online lecture, on April 6, the psychiatrist, Dr. Aruna Khilanani, who has a private practice in New York and is not affiliated with Yale, described a \u201cpsychological dynamic that is on PTSD repeat,\u201d in which people of color patiently explain racism to white people, who deny their attacks. When people of color then become angry, white people use that anger as \u201cconfirmation that we\u2019re crazy or have emotional problems,\u201d she said. She recalled a white therapist telling her in psychoanalysis that she was \u201cpsychotic\u201d whenever she expressed anger at racism, and said she had spent \u201cyears unpacking her racism to her,\u201d even though she was the one being charged for the sessions.\n\n\u201cThis is the cost of talking to white people at all \u2014 the cost of your own life, as they suck you dry,\u201d Dr. Khilanani said in the lecture, which drew widespread attention after Bari Weiss, a former writer and editor for the opinion department of The New York Times, posted an audio recording of it on Substack on Friday. \u201cThere are no good apples out there. White people make my blood boil.\u201d Dr. Khilanani added that around five years ago, \u201cI took some actions.\u201d \u201cI systematically white-ghosted most of my white friends, and I got rid of the couple white BIPOCs that snuck in my crew, too,\u201d she said, using an acronym for Black and Indigenous people and people of color. \u201cI had fantasies of unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way, burying their body and wiping my bloody hands as I walked away relatively guiltless with a bounce in my step, like I did the world a favor,\u201d she said, adding an expletive. Later in the lecture, Dr. Khilanani, who said she is of Indian descent, described the futility of trying to talk directly to white people about race, calling it a \u201cwaste of our breath.\u201d \u201cWe are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks that they are a saint or a superhero to accept responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen. They have five holes in their brain.\u201d\n\nDr. Khilanani, a forensic psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, said in an email on Saturday that her words had been taken out of context to \u201ccontrol the narrative.\u201d She said her lecture had \u201cused provocation as a tool for real engagement.\u201d \u201cToo much of the discourse on race is a dry, bland regurgitation of new vocabulary words with no work in the unconscious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, if you want to hit the unconscious, you will have to feel real negative feelings.\u201d She added: \u201cMy speaking metaphorically about my own anger was a method for people to reflect on negative feelings. To normalize negative feelings. Because if you don\u2019t, it will turn into a violent action.\u201d Dr. Khilanani noted that her lecture had initially been well received. After she gave it, several attendees praised her comments on the online feed. One woman who identified herself as a Yale psychologist called it \u201cabsolutely brilliant.\u201d A man said, \u201cI feel very shook in a good way,\u201d and a Black woman thanked Dr. Khilanani for giving \u201cvoice to us as people of color and what we go through all the time.\u201d Dr. Khilanani received her New York State medical license in 2008. Her website says that she has expertise in \u201cseeing both the conscious and unconscious structures of racism/sexism/homophobia/classism\u201d that allows for a safe environment when treating people from marginalized groups. Ms. Weiss released the recording of Dr. Khilanani\u2019s remarks at a time when many universities are debating teaching about race and racism and the limits of free speech.\n\nMs. Weiss also posted an interview with Dr. Khilanani by the journalist Katie Herzog. The Yale School of Medicine said in its statement that after Dr. Khilanani\u2019s talk, several faculty members had expressed concern about her remarks. Based on those concerns, leaders at the School of Medicine, in consultation with the chairwoman of the Child Study Center, reviewed a recording of the talk and \u201cfound the tone and content antithetical to the values of the school,\u201d the statement said. Because Grand Rounds are typically posted online, the statement said, school leaders then reviewed a university report on free expression at Yale in deciding how to handle Dr. Khilanani\u2019s lecture. \u201cIn deciding whether to post the video, we weighed our grave concern about the extreme hostility, imagery of violence, and profanity expressed by the speaker against our commitment to freedom of expression,\u201d the statement said. Ultimately, school leaders decided to limit access to the video to those who could have attended the talk \u2014 the members of the Yale community. School leaders also added a disclaimer to the video to \u201cemphasize that the ideas expressed by the speaker conflict with the core values of Yale School of Medicine,\u201d the statement said. The disclaimer reads, in part: \u201cYale School of Medicine expects the members of our community to speak respectfully to one another and to avoid the use of profanity as a matter of professionalism and acknowledgment of our common humanity. Yale School of Medicine does not condone imagery of violence or racism against any group.\u201d",

She recalled a white therapist telling her in psychoanalysis that she was \u201cpsychotic\u201d whenever she expressed anger at racism, and said she had spent \u201cyears unpacking her racism to her,\u201d even though she was the one being charged for the sessions.\n\n\u201cThis is the cost of talking to white people at all \u2014 the cost of your own life, as they suck you dry,\u201d Dr. Khilanani said in the lecture, which drew widespread attention after Bari Weiss, a former writer and editor for the opinion department of The New York Times, posted an audio recording of it on Substack on Friday.",

            "content": "The World Knows Her as \u2018Disaster Girl.\u2019 She Just Made $500,000 Off the Meme. Zo\u00eb Roth, now a college senior in North Carolina, plans to use the proceeds from this month\u2019s NFT auction to pay off student loans and donate to charity.\n\u2022 None As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe name Zo\u00eb Roth might not ring any bells. But chances are you\u2019ve seen her photo. One Saturday morning in 2005, when Ms. Roth was 4 years old, her family went to look at a house on fire in their neighborhood in Mebane, N.C. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire, so it was a relaxed affair: Neighbors gathered and firefighters allowed children to take turns holding the hose. Ms. Roth remembers watching the flames engulf the house when her father, an amateur photographer, asked her to smile. With her hair askew and a knowing look in her eyes, Ms. Roth flashed a devilish smirk as the fire roared behind her. \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d was born. In the years since Dave Roth, Zo\u00eb\u2019s father, entered it in a photo contest in 2007 and won, the image has been edited into various disasters from history, with Ms. Roth grinning impishly as a meteor wipes out the dinosaurs or the Titanic sinks in the distance. Now, after more than a decade of having her image endlessly repurposed as a vital part of meme canon, Ms. Roth has sold the original copy of her meme as a nonfungible token, or NFT, for nearly half a million dollars. The meme sold for 180 Ether, a form of cryptocurrency, at a Foundation auction on April 17 to a user identified as @3FMusic. As with any currency, the value of Ether fluctuates, but as of Thursday, 180 Ether was valued at more than $495,000. The Roths retained the copyright and will receive 10 percent of future sales. The market for ownership rights to digital art, ephemera and media known as NFTs, is exploding. All NFTs, including the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme Ms. Roth just sold, are stamped with a unique bit of digital code that marks their authenticity, and stored on the blockchain, a distributed ledger system that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the meme hall of fame, \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d ranks alongside \u201cErmahgerd,\u201d a pigtailed teenage girl posing with \u201cGoosebumps\u201d books; \u201cBad Luck Brian,\u201d immortalized in a grimacing yearbook photo with braces; and \u201cSuccess Kid,\u201d a toddler on a beach with a clenched fist and an expression of intense determination. In an interview, Ms. Roth said selling the meme was a way for her to take control over a situation that she has felt powerless over since she was in elementary school. Before making the decision to sell, Ms. Roth consulted \u201cBad Luck Brian\u201d himself \u2014 his real name is Kyle Craven \u2014 and Laney Griner, the mother of \u201cSuccess Kid.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that memes can do to take control,\u201d Ms. Roth recalled Mr. Craven telling her. \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d memes have spread far and wide. Once, a group from Poland asked permission to use the meme for educational material about a dying Indigenous language. Someone in Portugal sent Ms. Roth pictures of a mural with the meme. \u201cYou just make it fit however you want to fit it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love seeing them because I\u2019d never make any of them myself, but I love seeing how creative people are.\u201d Over the years, she\u2019s seen hundreds of iterations of her picture. One shared last summer during racial justice protests was among her favorites, she said. \u201cOnce it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s out there and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIt always finds a way to stay relevant with whatever new kind of awful, terrible bad thing is happening, so I\u2019ve laughed at a lot of them.\u201d Zo\u00eb Roth and her father, Dave, in Badlands National Park in 2019. Ms. Roth, now 21, is a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying peace, war and defense. She has never been recognized as \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d outright, she said, but most of her friends and acquaintances know of her meme fame. \u201cPeople who are in memes and go viral is one thing, but just the way the internet has held on to my picture and kept it viral, kept it relevant, is so crazy to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m super grateful for the entire experience.\u201d Even so, she said, she hopes to one day do something meaningful enough to shift \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d to the second page of search results for her name. After graduation, Ms. Roth plans to take a gap year before pursuing a graduate degree in international relations. She said she would donate the fortune she has made from her likeness \u2014 which is still in cryptocurrency form \u2014 to charities and to pay off her student loans, among other things. When she\u2019s home, she often walks past the lot where it all started and wonders if locals know that it\u2019s a \u201cmeme place,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are in memes didn\u2019t really have a choice in it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe internet is big. Whether you\u2019re having a good experience or a bad experience, you kind of just have to make the most of it.\u201d Ben Lashes, who manages the Roths and stars of other memes including \u201cNyan Cat,\u201d \u201cGrumpy Cat,\u201d \u201cKeyboard Cat,\u201d \u201cDoge,\u201d \u201cSuccess Kid,\u201d \u201cDavid After Dentist\u201d and the \u201cRidiculously Photogenic Guy,\u201d said his clients had cumulatively made over $2 million in NFT sales. He said that NFT sales had helped establish memes as a sophisticated art form and \u201cserious pieces of culture.\u201d \u201cI think anytime you can find a collector \u2014 no matter what the price is \u2014 who respects the art behind it and is going to cherish it, that\u2019s a successful sale, whether it\u2019s one Ether or 200 or 300,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Democratic lawmakers and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland want to change the names of more than 1,000 rivers, mountains and other places because they consider the names to be racist.\n\nBills introduced last week \u2014 one by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and the other by Rep. Al Green, Texas Democrat \u2014 also would eliminate the names of places that honor people who \u201cheld racially repugnant views\u201d or \u201ccarried out injustices against racial minorities,\u201d according to the legislation.\n\n\u201cRacism, even in geography, cannot be tolerated in a country that strives for liberty and justice for all,\u201d Mr. Green said.\n\nThe lawmakers refused to provide a list of names it targeted. Columbus Mountain in Colorado and other places named after Christopher Columbus could make the list because critics of the trans-Atlantic explorer say he was an instrument of injustice because of his ill treatment of indigenous people.\n\nColumbus is in the name of 55 populated places, including the capital of Ohio, eight dams, a glacier in Arkansas, and islands in Maine and Arkansas, according to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\n\nMs. Haaland, the nation\u2019s first American Indian Cabinet secretary, is exploring ways she can unilaterally rename places on public lands.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the options available for renaming places, including authorities that can be taken by the secretary, to better address a number of names that do not reflect who we are as a nation,\u201d Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said.\n\nEfforts to change offensive names of places have been proposed for decades, though with limited scope and limited results.\n\nIn 1963, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall ordered the removal from federal maps all places with names that included the N-word.\n\nStill, four graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified several objectionable place names in a recent article in Scientific American.\n\n\u201cMany of these features were named by locals decades or even centuries ago, based on the history of the town or even simply the fact that people of color existed in proximity to the town,\u201d they wrote. \u201cChinaman Trail in New Mexico was likely named such because Chinese laborers constructed the original trail as part of mining operations. A peak in the Mojave Desert in California is to this day named Pickaninny Buttes, likely because African Americans settled in that region,\u201d they wrote.\n\nPickaninny refers to a small black child and is considered offensive.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Geological Survey database, the names of 766 places across the country include the word \u201cnegro.\u201d A total of 27 places, including five mountain summits, have names that include the term \u201cChinaman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a just society when racist names are officially sanctioned,\u201d graduate students Meghana Ranganathan, Julia Wilcots, Rohini Shivamoggi and Diana Dumit wrote.\n\nSometimes, name changes don\u2019t go far enough for the offended parties.\n\nIn 2011, Gail and Zeke Smith bought land in Nevada County, Nevada, and objected to the name of N\u2014\u2014- Creek, which ran through their property. The county renamed it Negro Creek.\n\nStill uncomfortable with the name, the Smiths asked for it to be changed to \u201cBlack Miners Creek.\u201d The county refused, saying most locals wanted to reflect what they had called the creek for years.\n\nCritics say the renaming effort is another attempt by the political left to cleanse or cancel U.S. history, similar to arguments against removing Confederate statues.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with the intended purpose but in an attempt to rewrite our history, no different than the way the Russian Communist Party used to rewrite the Great Soviet Encyclopedia whenever someone fell out of favor with the party,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.\n\n\u201cWe should do all we can to preserve all of our history, both good and bad, so that we are well-educated on everything this country has experienced and to ensure that we do not in the future make some of the mistakes we have made in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cDestroying and rewriting history that does not fit within today\u2019s cultural norms is a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe Board on Geographic Names has the authority to change the names of places it considers offensive and has occasionally done so. The board has jurisdiction over natural features, populated places, canals and reservoirs. It has not, however, renamed as many places as the left has proposed.\n\nWith their legislation, Ms. Warren and Mr. Green would create a special task force charged with eradicating names it considers offensive. The task force would identify offensive place names and press the Board on Geographic Names to rename them.\n\nSome local governments have been reexamining names of landmarks in recent years. Texas in 1991 attempted to replace the names of places that use the word \u201cnegro\u201d with the names of significant Black people in the state\u2019s history. The Board on Geographic Names initially rejected the changes. In June, however, the board reversed decisions and renamed 16 places with names such as \u201cNegro Creek\u201d and \u201cNegrohead Lake.\u201d\n\nThe federal government often overrules states on which places should be renamed.\n\nIn 2016, tribal leaders in South Dakota called on the state to rename Harney Peak in the Black Hills. The peak, the highest point in the state, was named after Army Gen. William S. Harney, whose soldiers massacred American Indian women and children during a battle in September 1855.\n\nThe state\u2019s board that is responsible for naming places rejected the petition in response to public opposition.\n\nWhen the federal board overruled the state, Sen. John Thune, South Dakota Republican, objected \u2014 not because he wanted to honor the massacre but because he believed it was an issue of states\u2019 rights.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Thune declined to comment on Ms. Warren\u2018s bill. Mr. Thune said in 2016 that he was \u201csurprised and upset by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names\u2018 unilateral decision to rename Harney Peak, one of South Dakota\u2019s most well-known landmarks.\u201d",

            "content": "Graduation day has arrived for the eight brands that have completed the Sephora Accelerate Incubator Program which started back in February. The program\u2019s focus this year was on Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) founders. The culminating event for the brands was pitch day at the end of May where each brand founder gave a formal presentation to a group of industry experts, investors, and senior-level Sephora leaders in an effort to unlock investment and scale their brands. A wide spectrum of investors were present at pitch day, from angel investors to venture capitalists to private equity. The 2021 brands include 54 Thrones, Eadem, Glory, Hyper Skin, lmania Beauty, Kulfi Beauty, ries, and Topicals.\n\nThe Accelerate program included onboarding/orientation, boot camp and presentation/planning, followed by pitch day and graduation day. I had the opportunity to speak with some of the founders and participants in this year\u2019s program to better understand their experience and what we can expect next from their brands.\n\n54 Thrones sources all of its ingredients from Africa\n\nChristina Funke Tegbe, founder of 54 Thrones, created her company as an indulgent clean-beauty brand grown on African soil and ethically sourced. Her beauty collections pay homage to the many African cultures and evoke the essence of the continent. One of the hero products, African beauty butter, is loved by Oprah as one of her favorites and comes in many different product assortments. Tegbe said about the Sephora Accelerate program, \u201cOne of the most rewarding aspects was meeting the other program participants, and in particular the group of women founders from this year was especially amazing.\u201d She discussed how having the access and opportunity to network with the group was very beneficial to her, in addition to getting advice and instruction from the many mentors in the program. Tegbe stated, \u201cSephora took decades of industry knowledge and packed it into six months for us.\u201d\n\nThe Accelerate program included marketing lessons on brand strategy and DNA from Mark Ritson, a legend in the marketing industry with decades of experience in brand building. Ritson\u2019s clients include Tatcha, Shiseido, De Beers, Benefit, Subaru, Johnson and Johnson to name a few. Additionally, for 13 years, he served as the in-house brand consultant for LVMH.\n\nTegbe discussed how after listening to Ritson\u2019s marketing tips, she viewed her own brand differently and the key piece of advice she took away from that aspect of the program was to take pleasure in breaking the rules. Tegbe said, \u201cBranding is key and this philosophy gave me the freedom to look at the brand differently.\u201d Tegbe was confident in her pitch and was appreciative that Sephora put her in the room with interested investors to get the conversations started.\n\nHyper Skin is an easy, results-oriented skincare brand rooted in multiculturalism. According to Desiree Verdejo, CEO and founder of Hyper Skin, \u201cWe\u2019re hyper-targeted on treating dark spots and discoloration on all skin tones, and enhancing glow delivering real results.\u201d Verdejo\u2019s participation in the program was supported by merchants from Sephora. The mentoring was key in building meaningful relationships and helpful with on-boarding and business aspects.\n\nAdditionally, the entire team that runs Accelerate is very dynamic and creates an environment of support across the many facets of launching a brand. Verdejo recalls that her natural inclination is to work on product and branding, but she had to learn to prioritize some other areas like building out a strong operations process in order to successfully launch and scale a brand. Program highlights included how to go about first hires and create accounting best practices. Mentors who have previously launched brands at Sephora were instrumental in breaking it down and keeping things simple.\n\nOn pitch day, Verdejo felt confident and comfortable conversing with the many investors who participated in the meeting. She stated, \u201cWhile no one came with a blank check, investors truly understood the market and they were all very capable of supporting a start-up beauty brand.\u201d\n\nKulfi Beauty is on a mission to empower products for self-expression\n\nPriyanka Ganjoo, founder of Kulfi Beauty, described her brand by saying: \u201cWe bring joy to makeup with South Asian culture and provide products that empower self-expression.\u201d The Sephora Accelerate program provided access to key merchants and other stakeholders in the company which was a tremendous help to Ganjoo. Speakers across many functions of the business like marketing and operations created an opportunity for tangible feedback for the brand. A key highlight for Ganjoo was hearing Aurora James speak to the founders about the 15% pledge which she established. The pledge is a call to action for major retailers to dedicate 15% of shelf space to Black owned businesses. The fireside chat between Artemis Patrick, global chief marketing officer of Sephora, and James included a discussion about what led her to start the 15% pledge. James also talked about her own experience as a fellow female brand founder of color.\n\nGanjoo believes the support from Sephora created a community of people that wanted the founders to succeed. Sephora knows the customers best and each brand knows its community best, so working together provides richer output. Ganjoo said, \u201cUnderstanding the gaps with clients and then being able to fill in the gaps with products that make sense creates a great partnership.\u201d The mentors of the Accelerate program were able to share personal anecdotes and stories about their own journey in launching a brand at Sephora which were, according to Ganjoo, \u201cBoth heartwarming and providing real world feedback.\u201d\n\nPitch day felt like graduation, and although Ganjoo wished it was in person as opposed to virtual, Sephora curated a group of investors that had an interest in growing beauty brands which made the day very relevant for future growth. Investors understood the importance of keeping the brands consumer centric, building a loyal following and staying connected with the community.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of the program\n\nThe founders of the emerging brands that were interviewed agreed that the most challenging aspect of the Sephora Accelerate program was trying to find the bandwidth to continue to run your own business while participating in the highly intensive program. With that said, however, every brand also agreed that they would not have it any other way. The program was invaluable and will certainly help them succeed in growing and scaling their businesses.\n\nWhile no specific launch days were announced, the brands were enthusiastic about becoming part of the Sephora family. The Accelerate program has supported the launch of more than 50 women-owned brands over its six year history. The focus on BIPOC owned brands this year furthers Sephora\u2019s commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all shoppers.",

Mentors who have previously launched brands at Sephora were instrumental in breaking it down and keeping things simple.\n\nOn pitch day, Verdejo felt confident and comfortable conversing with the many investors who participated in the meeting. Pitch day felt like graduation, and although Ganjoo wished it was in person as opposed to virtual, Sephora curated a group of investors that had an interest in growing beauty brands which made the day very relevant for future growth. The focus on BIPOC owned brands this year furthers Sephora\u2019s commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all shoppers.",

            "content": "Art at \u201cSeeing Differently,\u201d at the Phillips Collection, includes two 20-foot pieces by Howard Hodgkin, \u201cAs Time Goes By (red)\u201d and \u201cAs Time Goes By (blue),\u201d from 2009.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThis article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience. The American art collector Duncan Phillips opened the doors of the Phillips Collection on a quiet side street in the Washington, D.C., neighborhood of Dupont Circle 100 years ago. Mr. Phillips\u2019s motivation for the museum, then called The Phillips Memorial Gallery, was to heal from the loss of his father, Major Duncan Phillips, a Civil War veteran who died suddenly in 1917 from a heart condition, and his brother James Laughlin Phillips, who perished in the 1918 influenza pandemic. \u201cSorrow all but overwhelmed me,\u201d wrote Mr. Phillips in his 1926 book \u201cA Collection in the Making.\u201d \u201cThen I turned to my love of painting for the will to live.\u201d At the time, the intimate museum, which is still housed in his family home, included 237 works. That number has since grown to nearly 6,000.\n\nTo mark its centennial, the museum is showcasing more than 200 works in a show, spread across the entire mansion and galleries, entitled \u201cSeeing Differently: The Phillips Collects for a New Century,\u201d through Sept. 12. The exhibition features artists from the 19th century to the present across gender, national and racial lines. It includes paintings, works on paper, prints, photographs, sculptures, quilts and videos. As the country begins to mend from Covid-19, the parallel of the exhibit is uncanny \u2014 the museum itself arose as means to heal from death during the earlier pandemic.\n\nThe historical parallels between the show and the founding of its venue are not lost on Ms. Kosinski. \u201cIt gives me shivers that a hundred years later our world is again totally wrapped up in an influenza pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d Mr. Phillips wrote in his book: \u201cArt offers two great gifts of emotion \u2014 the emotion of recognition and the emotion of escape. Both emotions take us out of the boundaries of self. At my period of crisis, I was prompted to create something which would express my awareness of life\u2019s returning joys and my potential escape in to the land of artists\u2019 dreams.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s galleries are arranged by themes of identity, history, place and the senses. \u201cWe took very seriously all the different intertwined emergencies and urgencies that unfolded around us in the last year,\u201d Ms. Kosinski said. \u201cHealth is not only one\u2019s physical health, but also the health and well-being of the community in which we live and work and that we serve. Art can be soothing, and it can be thought-provoking.\u201d\n\nWorks include the haunting, but hopeful images from Jeanine Michna-Bales\u2019s photographic essay \u201cThrough Darkness to Light: Photographs Along the Underground Railroad.\u201d Benny Andrews\u2019s \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d retraces the forced march west in the 1830s of Native Americans from Florida, during which thousands died. Part painting and part collage, Mr. Andrews\u2019s technique uses painted fabric and oil on four canvases in a three-dimensional method to evoke the weight of bundles and shrouds people carried with them. It reminds one, however, of the plight of refugees fleeing oppressors today. \u201cIt is a monumental work,\u201d Ms. Kosinski said. \u201cIt\u2019s the displacement of the Indigenous peoples westward. I can\u2019t even think of another major work of art that deals with that subject.\u201d \u201cWe present history in this country by submerging those harrowing tales. And so, for me, that\u2019s about spiritual health and sense of civic and community health to be confronted with that image. Its majesty is important and bracing and inspiring to me.\u201d\n\nThree 20th-century quilts, by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, Black community in Alabama, exude a sense of community and resourcefulness. These patchworks of salvaged remnants of worn work clothes and faded denim, feed sacks and threadbare fabric \u201care an explosion of radiance and color and inventive expression,\u201d Ms. Kosinski said. A forthcoming juried exhibition, \u201cInside Outside, Upside Down,\u201d running from July 17 to Sept. 12, builds on Mr. Phillips\u2019s commitment to presenting, acquiring and promoting the work of artists from the D.C. metropolitan area. Local artists were invited to submit work created between March 2020 and February 2021 that speaks to the struggle and resiliency of the human spirit in the face of the global Covid-19 pandemic and recent social upheavals. A jury composed of Elsa Smithgall, senior curator at the Phillips Collection; Abigail McEwen, associate professor of Latin American Art at the University of Maryland; Phil Hutinet, publisher of East City Arts; and Ren\u00e9e Stout, a visual artist based in Washington and the guest curator of the upcoming exhibition, reviewed the 1,300 plus entries through two rounds. They were eventually whittled down to 65 works that range from painting to drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed media and video.\n\nThe year 2020 \u201cleft us all discombobulated and disoriented in various ways,\u201d Ms. Stout said. \u201cThe themes that emerged in the works ran the spectrum \u2014 from coping with feelings of depression brought on by the isolation of sheltering in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic to domestic discord or abuse as a result of the same, and the rage and frustration of names being added to the already too long list of names of unarmed Black people who have been killed by police in this country.\u201d But the subjects that emerged were also about \u201cfinding comfort within the family unit or appreciating the quiet solace of nature during isolation, as well as how the pandemic and social upheavals are forcing each of us to reassess who we are and our relationship to our community and the greater society,\u201d she said.\n\nOne distinctive aspect to the upcoming exhibition is that it wasn\u2019t just open to professionally trained artists with a number of shows under their belts. \u201cIt includes emerging and self-taught artists who may have \u2018day jobs\u2019 as well,\u201d Ms. Stout said. \u201cDuring the process, I saw art by so many artists that I had not heard of before this call, and as a juror, that was refreshing.\u201d \u201cInside Outside, Upside Down\u201d confirms the mission of the museum\u2019s founder. \u201cWhen we talk about art and wellness, or if we talk about the museum and community, we\u2019re really talking about our community and equity or social justice. We are firm and deliberate and committed to bringing in the voices of the community and to give the platform to artists,\u201d Ms. Kosinski said.",

            "content": "The Esrange Space Center, which shares a landing zone that is more than 2,000 square miles, will be a testing ground for Europe\u2019s first reusable vertical rocket in 2022.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe government is turning an old research base above the Arctic Circle into a state-of-the-art satellite launching center. The reindeer will not be happy.\n\nKIRUNA, Sweden \u2014 The path to the reindeer herder\u2019s spring home took him across four frozen lakes and countless snowy hilltops. Arriving to a light dusting of snow, the herder, Aslak Allas, switched off his snowmobile, and the overwhelming silence of Sweden\u2019s Arctic settled in. His reindeer, thousands of them, were nowhere to be seen. \u201cThey are very scared of noise,\u201d Mr. Allas explained, pointing to his vehicle. He then motioned toward the distant hills dotted with birch trees, their buds swelling with the warming spring sun. \u201cNow, the noise coming from there, that will be something else,\u201d Mr. Allas sighed.\n\nWith the crystal-clear air of the Arctic night and a decent telescope, it\u2019s easy to pick out some of the thousands of shoebox-size commercial satellites orbiting the earth. Their numbers are set to explode in the coming decade, powered by the use of light, reusable rockets developed by innovative U.S. companies like Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. He and several competitors are planning to send up to 50,000 such satellites into space in coming years, compared with fewer than 3,000 out there now. While the United States, China, Russia and several other countries already have spaceports, Sweden\u2019s would be the first orbital launch site for satellites in Europe \u2014 capable of launching spacecraft into orbit around Earth or on interplanetary trajectories. Currently, the intergovernmental European Space Agency launches its traditional single-use Ariane rockets from French Guiana. Several private European companies are designing spaceports in Europe to host a new generation of smaller rockets. Portugal is looking into building one on the Azores Islands, two remote sites have been allocated in Britain and Norway is upgrading its Andoya Space Center.\n\nIn 1972, the Swedish government took over the base from the European Space Agency, which no longer needed it. For decades, the Swedes hired out the site for smaller, slower research rockets, satellite ground-control services and the launching of stratospheric balloons. But with the commercial space race promising new revenue, the government-owned Swedish Space Corporation, which manages the site, is offering launch services to private ventures wishing to send satellites into space. \u201cWe are a bit of a unicorn in the space business,\u201d said Philip Pahlsson, vice president for strategy and innovation of the Swedish Space Corporation, referring to the government ownership of the site. \u201cBut we do plan on being the awesomest company in the government\u2019s portfolio.\u201d\n\nEsrange shares a landing zone that is more than 2,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the size of Rhode Island \u2014 with a local population of mostly bears, wolves, reindeer and a handful of herders like Mr. Allas. If a launch should fail, it would be highly unlikely to cause any damage to human settlements. For certain satellites \u2014 those launched into polar orbits \u2014 an Arctic location offers key advantages. These orbits, passing over the North and South Poles, are ideal for Earth-observing satellites, because as the Earth rotates, the entire surface of the planet passes underneath. And it takes less energy to launch to a polar orbit from higher latitudes.\n\nThat base lies close to Kiruna, Sweden\u2019s northernmost city and home to the largest underground iron ore mine in the world. It is so huge, in fact, that several neighborhoods are being moved, as the city is slowly sinking into the excavated caverns below. A 50-foot rocket stands at one of the main intersections, a testament to Sweden\u2019s space ambitions. Space is woven into the fabric of the city. The Swedish Institute of Space Physics is based in Kiruna, as is the Space High School for gifted teenagers. The space engineering program at Lulea University of Technology, also in Kiruna, attracts Ph.D. students from across Europe. An enormous satellite receiver dish, sticking out from the woods in a vast white valley, serves as a geographical landmark. Esrange has many of the attributes of other spaceports \u2014 high fences and warning signs, and some used rockets on display. But it also has a church, a visitor center and the Aurora hotel, named for the northern lights that color the winter skies. Snow is everywhere, of course, and reindeer roam the terrain (no one knows how they get past the fences), but astronauts and moon landers are nowhere to be found.\n\nLeading a tour of the grounds, Mr. Pahlsson became slightly agitated when a photographer began snapping pictures. \u201cWe have contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of our customers don\u2019t like their equipment to be photographed.\u201d The launchpads for the orbital rockets, mostly piles of construction equipment and materials at this point, are rising four miles from the central site. Pointing at a pile of sand during a tour of the grounds, Mr. Pahlsson said this was the site of their future \u201claunch-vehicle integration building.\u201d By the end of next year, he said, they hoped to use the launch site to test Europe\u2019s first reusable rocket, called Themis, after an ancient Greek Titaness who was the personification of divine order. On this day, the main activity consisted of engine testing by two fiercely competitive German space start-ups, Rocket Factory Augsburg and ISAR Aerospace Technologies.\n\nSweden\u2019s space minister, Matilda Ernkrans, in an interview said that she expected the base to play a key role in helping to map global climate change. Back at his modest dwelling, Mr. Allas, the reindeer herder, would second that notion, and he is planning to do something about it, even if his backyard is one of the few not attached one way or another to the space industry. Mr. Allas is more than a man with a snowmobile and lots of reindeer. He is chairman of the Talma sameby, one of the larger Sami districts in Sweden. The Sami are the last Indigenous people of Europe and live in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. In 2019, after an appeal by his district, Mr. Allas managed to block some of the expansion plans for the base, and now his sights are set on the coming noise pollution.",

Portugal is looking into building one on the Azores Islands, two remote sites have been allocated in Britain and Norway is upgrading its Andoya Space Center. But with the commercial space race promising new revenue, the government-owned Swedish Space Corporation, which manages the site, is offering launch services to private ventures wishing to send satellites into space.",

Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.] \u201cSkipped History,\u201d a comedy web series, explores overlooked ideas, people and events that continue to shape the United States. Hosted by Ben Tumin, a historical satirist, the series makes history both accessible and funny. \u201cTo me, the reality is that history is endlessly compelling,\u201d Mr. Tumin said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking for answers for how the society we live in became the society that it is today, and it\u2019s such a flawed society in so many ways, that finding where things went wrong helps to reimagine how things could go right in the future.\u201d The first season of \u201cSkipped History\u201d was met with praise from prominent historians. Greg Grandin, a history professor and Pulitzer Prize winner, called the show \u201ca treasure,\u201d after an episode that explored the racially motivated reasons for America\u2019s first major war abroad in the Philippines. \u201cThere are statistics that students in high school and middle school typically find history to be one of the most boring subjects,\u201d Mr. Tumin said. \u201cAnd meanwhile, there are all these academics and educators doing incredible work and unearthing incredible history that we had no idea about. So the question is not, \u2018Is history interesting?\u2019 It\u2019s about how you present it.\u201d\n\nI recently spoke with Mr. Tumin about the creation of \u201cSkipped History,\u201d the importance of U.S. history and why so many of the stories Mr. Tumin has told have been forgotten or overlooked. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. How did \u201cSkipped History\u201d get started? Before the pandemic, I was a live performer of longer-form humorous historical pieces. I was set to go on tour with a piece exploring a U.S.-led coup in Guatemala in 1954. This was in 2018. And so inspired by [President Trump\u2019s] travel ban, I dug into the history of refugees and made a 45-minute presentation featuring comedic interviews with Syrian refugees. I\u2019d show polls from 1938 of citizens in the U.S. and their views of refugees then and compare them to polls now and show very clear parallels.\n\nAfterward, in the conversations with audiences, people were always interested in more history. That\u2019s when I was like, OK, time to dig into more history. I studied history in college and I love reading history books. I\u2019m just naturally very curious and a bit nerdy. The pandemic was a very unwelcome opportunity to catch up on a lot of history books that I hadn\u2019t had time to read because I\u2019ve been traveling around so much, and once I started reading those books, the idea just kind of came together.\n\nAn extensive amount of research, including videos, goes into each episode. How do you find all the elements that you include? I\u2019ll read a book that maybe a historian has recommended to me or that has gotten a lot of notice or just sounds interesting. And I look for moments or people or ideas that I didn\u2019t know about, that just make me catch my breath and are astounding. For example, how is it possible that a racist German statistician in the 1890s wrote a deeply flawed book on race and crime statistics, and then these statistics and his analysis spread around the U.S. to the point that police departments still unwittingly cite his analysis to justify tactics like stop-and-frisk? I\u2019ll look for moments like that and ask myself: How is this possible? Because it seems fitting. It seems in line with the currents of U.S. history. But it also seems so outrageous and it\u2019s something that maybe other people would be interested in learning. Why is it important to tell these stories? In 1970, James Baldwin wrote a letter to Angela Davis in which he said, \u201cWhat has happened, it seems to me, and to put it far too simply, is that a whole new generation of people have assessed and absorbed their history, and, in that tremendous action, have freed themselves of it and will never be victims again.\u201d And I think that\u2019s revealing of the empowering nature of history and how it can be really joyous and fulfilling to learn. Why do you think a lot of this history has been skipped? I would borrow a phrase from historian Tiya Miles, who describes \u201cthe conundrum of the archives,\u201d that is how the historical record tends to relate what people in power want it to relate. I love and admire historians for conducting an unheralded form of resistance and combing through archives to reveal what many people would rather we never knew. In turn, it\u2019s a joy to bring those stories to life in a different way on \u201cSkipped History\u201d and shine more light on historians\u2019 work.\n\nI also think the reason so many moments in history are skipped is because there\u2019s erasure of U.S. history. Making history uninteresting is part of U.S. history. Writing a racist version of history into schools is part of U.S. history. And on the flip side, we now have more interest in learning what that real history is and people are producing it. Think about all of these different history commissions around the U.S. trying to come up with their counters to the 1619 Project, which is a revelatory and remarkable piece of history that represents this really interesting moment where people are looking at U.S. history in new ways. And maybe most importantly, we are now seeing people like Nikole Hannah-Jones or Elizabeth Hinton having the platforms to publish these pieces and get the attention and respect that their really incredible work deserves. Season 2 of \u201cSkipped History\u201d is wrapping up. Are there any stories you hope to cover in the third season? Season 3 is going to focus on economic history, some environmental history and some more Indigenous people\u2019s history. Plus the through-currents that seem to be behind every episode, which is white supremacy growth unchecked. There are also a few other things that I want to cover. How would you describe \u201cSkipped History\u201d for new viewers? I think for new viewers there\u2019s a mixture of seriousness and silliness to \u201cSkipped History.\u201d And I say that it\u2019s possible to insert levity without taking things lightly. People often associate history with being drab and also with being really depressing, and that\u2019s one of the barriers for a lot of people. And honestly, I think everyone who studies history is affected by that. I think it\u2019s important to know that you can discuss these subjects in ways that are really interesting and still make jokes and make it entertaining.",

            "description": "Why Are Colombians Protesting?  The New York Times",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nDemonstrations have filled the streets of major cities for a over month and at least 46 people have died. On Sunday, President Iv\u00e1n Duque announced he would push for police reform. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the protests.\n\nBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Protests have rocked Colombia for more than a month, with thousands of people pouring into the streets of its major cities, demonstrators blocking major roads and the police responding at times with lethal force. At least 46 people, many of them protesters, have died. On Sunday, President Iv\u00e1n Duque announced that he would ask Congress to pass measures aimed at reforming the country\u2019s national police, including the creation of a human rights directorate within the department and the introduction of body cameras for all street-level officers. Allegations of police abuse have drawn international condemnation since the protests began. Mr. Duque said such reforms would help the department \u201cstrengthen the policy of defense, protection and guardianship of human rights.\u201d Interviews and video analysis by The New York Times show that police officers have fired bullets at peaceful protesters, beaten demonstrators in custody and fired tear gas canisters or other forms of \u201cless-lethal\u201d ammunition at people from close range. At least three officers now face murder charges.\n\nIn an interview after the president\u2019s announcement, defense minister Diego Molano characterized the reform as part of a package that the government had in the works before the protests began. \u201cThe president\u2019s instruction is to speed up that reform.\u201d Mr. Duque\u2019s request comes as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights prepares to visit the country. The commission will arrive on June 8 and stay for two days, meeting with government officials, civic organizations and others, before producing a series of recommendations. The changes to the police force will be proposed to Congress on the first day of the new legislative session this July.\n\nBut the outpouring quickly morphed into a widespread expression of anger over poverty and inequality \u2014 which have risen as the virus has spread \u2014 and over the violence with which the police have confronted the movement. Students, teachers, health workers, farmers, Indigenous communities and many others have come together in the streets. \u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d said Sergio Romero, 23, at a recent protest in Bogot\u00e1. Demonstrators\u2019 demands began with a repeal of the tax proposal. But they have grown over time to include calls for the government to guarantee a minimum income, to prevent police violence and to withdraw a health care overhaul that critics say does not do enough to fix systemic problems. So far, demonstrators have managed to topple both the tax proposal and the health plan. And Mr. Duque has rolled out several programs intended to help struggling families, including one that will partially subsidize salaries for employers who hire young people. But this has done little to quell the anger. And as time has passed, the protests have further divided an already polarized society \u2014 with supporters saying the marches are the only way to get an entrenched political class to listen, and opponents saying that protesters\u2019 messages have been eclipsed by the violent acts of some demonstrators.\n\nHis tax plan sought to keep in place new subsidies for poor people, while raising taxes on many everyday goods and services. Many economists said that some kind of fiscal restructuring was necessary, but many Colombians viewed the plan as an attack on their already difficult existences. Even before the pandemic, many Colombians with full-time jobs struggled to make even the minimum wage of about $275 a month. For example, Helena Osorio, 24, is a nurse who works nights and earns $13 per shift caring for Covid patients, barely enough for her and her younger brother to survive. This pushed her to attend recent protests. Then she quit her job \u2014 and started working on the front lines of the rallies, as part of a brigade of health workers caring for injured demonstrators. The president\u2019s tax proposal also came as coronavirus cases and deaths were rising in the country, leaving hundreds of desperate Colombians to wait for a bed at overloaded hospitals.\n\nWhat else are Colombians angry about? The tax proposal was a catalyst that brought longstanding frustrations to a boil. Colombia is among the most unequal countries in the world. A report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018 said that it would take 11 generations for a poor Colombian to approach the mean income in his or her society \u2014 the highest number of 30 countries examined. Despite reductions in poverty in the decades before the pandemic, many Colombians, particularly the young, feel the engines of upward mobility are beyond their reach.\n\nMany Colombians are also frustrated by the government\u2019s carrying out its side of the peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The deal, signed in 2016, was supposed to end generations of armed conflict. The rebels would lay down arms, and the government would bring economic opportunity to rural areas that had suffered during the war and would meet other commitments. But Mr. Duque\u2019s party strongly opposed the deal, saying it went too easy on the FARC. His critics say he has not been aggressive enough in setting up the programs that were supposed to help cement peace, including one that would help coca-growing families switch to other crops. And violence continues in many rural areas, fueling frustration. As the protests have escalated, resulting in clashes between demonstrators and police, Mr. Duque\u2019s government has frequently blamed the violence on armed groups it says have infiltrated the protests.\n\nHave the protesters engaged in violence as well? Protesters have also blocked major roads, preventing food and other essential goods from getting through. Officials say this has hampered efforts to fight the coronavirus at a time when new cases and virus deaths are at near record highs. The defense department says that hundreds of officers have been hurt, that one officer has been killed and that people associated with the protests have vandalized police stations, setting one on fire with officers inside. While tens of thousands have marched in the streets, not everyone supports the protests. Jhon Henry Morales, 51, a taxi driver in Cali, said his city had been nearly paralyzed, with some protesters blocking the roads with tires.",

And Mr. Duque has rolled out several programs intended to help struggling families, including one that will partially subsidize salaries for employers who hire young people. The defense department says that hundreds of officers have been hurt, that one officer has been killed and that people associated with the protests have vandalized police stations, setting one on fire with officers inside.",

            "description": "The anger driving Colombia's protest movement isn't going away anytime soon  CNN",
            "content": "Bogot\u00e1 (CNN) What started as a tax reform proposal to help ease the strain of the pandemic on the economy and balance government finances ended with people taking to the streets to express their discontent.\n\nLast week, Colombia's Attorney General's Office released a statement charging the police officer, Luis \u00c1ngel Piedrahita Hern\u00e1ndez, with aggravated homicide in connection to the killing of Marcelo Agredo Inchima. Officer Piedrahita Hern\u00e1ndez maintains his innocence and the case will go before a criminal court.\n\nThe charges were announced on the same day that the head of Colombia's National Police, General Jorge Luis Vargas, just four months into the new role, defended the credibility of the force -- which has been fiercely criticized for its heavy-handed response to the protests -- while admitting that police would be the first to recognize their faults.\n\nThe institution the general oversees has found itself in the middle of a credibility crisis, as reports of human rights violations increase and international humanitarian groups including the United Nations voice concerns. On Saturday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) formally requested access to the country to investigate these abuse allegations.\n\nAt least 42 people have died in the protests according to Colombia's Ombudsman Office. Rights groups say the death toll could be higher. According to a compilation by human rights organization Temblores, at least 2,387 cases of police violence have been reported.\n\nMarcelo Agredo Inchima was among the first casualties that resulted in the protests, on a day when social media videos of brutal repression by police would ignite fury across an already angered nation.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Agredo and his brother joined an anti-tax bill rally on April 28, the first day of protests in Cali \u2014 a city in southwest Colombia that would soon become the heart of the movement. Little did they know it would be the last day he would be seen alive.\n\nA second social media video from another angle shows Agredo running and then falling to the ground. A third shows his body on the pavement in a pool of blood, as people frantically try to move him. \"They killed him!\" a woman screams, terror resonating in her voice.\n\n\"No, he's already dead,\" she sobs near Agredo's still body.\n\n\"My kid died there as a result of a shot that a police officer gave him. My son attacked a policeman with a kick,\" Armando Agredo Bustamante said, arguing the kick wasn't a reason to take his son's life when his son was unarmed and \"defenseless.\"\n\nFor many Colombians, what started as protests over the now-withdrawn tax reform that would have hit many families already struggling economically, have transformed into a cry to end excessive police force directed at protesters\u2014 something they say has plagued the nation for decades.\n\n\"The way that they decided to take these things is to bring the police and the military forces against their own people. That's why we are all here,\" Juan Pablo Randazzo, 21, told CNN during a peaceful protest in the capital of Bogot\u00e1, the brightly colored yellow, blue and red Colombian flag wrapped around his neck like a cape.\n\n\"We are not prepared to hear the next day that one of our friends, that one of our family, that one of our brothers is getting killed,\" the university student added with emotion in his voice.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour last week, Colombian president Iv\u00e1n Duque announced 65 investigations have been opened into police abuse adding that there were \"strict protocols\" on the use of force in the country.\n\nDuque said his government had \"always trusted and defended the fundamental right in our institution for specific protests.\"\n\nNevertheless, government officials also maintain that leftist militants and illegal armed groups are behind some of the violence.\n\nLast week, Colombia's Defense Ministry announced security forces had detained a leader of a local cell of the largest leftist guerrilla group in the country, the National Liberation Army (ELN). The Ministry accused him of attempting to blend into the protests in Cali with plans to detonate a hand grenade and blame security forces, but offered no proof.\n\nProtesters have burned public buses, police precincts, looted stores and blocked roads throughout the nation, further hampering the economy and flow of goods.\n\n\"The Colombian Constitution does not establish the right to block, for violence, or vandalism,\" Interior Minister Daniel Palacios said on Twitter. \"The blockades generate poverty, don't build a country and end the economy,\" he added.\n\nNegotiations between the Colombian government, indigenous groups and the National Strike Committee are ongoing but have so far been unsuccessful. Even President Duque's announcement last week to cut tuition for lower-income students in the second semester of 2021 has failed to stem the protests.\n\nMeanwhile, Colombians are sinking deeper into poverty, a problem exacerbated by the pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. According to the country's National Statistics Department (DANE), the poverty rate increased from 36 percent in 2019 to 42.5 percent in 2020.\n\nSociology and history professor Jose Alejandro Cifuentes tells CNN the economic situation Colombia faces is grim and entangled with its history of civil war and inequality.\n\n\"We are in a very serious situation in the face of access to higher education, employment, and we are facing a situation of high informal employment that is the only space left for these youths,\" Cifuentes said in regard to the many young Colombians taking to the streets to voice their frustrations and concerns.\n\nNot only has the pandemic hit the future generations though. It has also affected people like Marlon Rincon Peralta, 46, a father of five who we met as he waved down the few visitors who drove past his mostly empty tables.\n\nRincon Peralta was forced to go from business owner to waiting tables at a restaurant in the once bustling colonial tourist town of Zipaquir\u00e1, north of the capital.\n\n\"Never, never have I seen this situation,\" Rincon Peralta told CNN as he got emotional sharing how the pandemic only helped make the rich richer and the poor poorer due to the inequality the country has faced and continues to live.\n\nFinancially, he is at his worst.\n\n\"I tell my wife, my kids, if we continue like this, no, no... what are we going to do?\" he said with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"The pandemic has a cure,\" he said but the economy and inequality doesn't. \"If we don't do something, we will never have a cure.\"",

Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently, \" The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. \" The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) One year after George Floyd's murder , America finds itself at an existential crossroads: this nation can create a multiracial democracy that guarantees Black citizenship and dignity -- or sustain the status quo of racial oppression undergirded by White supremacy.\n\nFor a brief moment, dramatic -- even revolutionary -- change seemed not just possible, but inevitable. Black Lives Matter activists created an indelible image of a beloved community whose reach could surpass the political achievements of the civil rights movement. When 15,000 turned out in Brooklyn for a BLM march in support of Black Trans Lives, you could feel history's pulsating throb in real time. Black women, many of them queer and feminist, led many of these efforts. They were joined by Latinx, indigenous, Asian American and Pacific Islander and White communities who found moral and political renewal in acknowledging Black lives mattered as much as their own.\n\nBreonna Taylor, a Black woman killed by Louisville police while sleeping in her bed, posthumously graced the cover of Vanity Fair in a kind of historic recognition of the value of Black women so often denied them (even in national conversations about Black death). The potential for democratic transformation seemed immense.\n\nThat possibility, in much of the year since, has at best progressed into a raised national consciousness about the realities of systemic racism and, at worst, devolved into a politicized shouting match over whether America is or is not a racist country, a searing battle about to whom our history belongs. But that summer of protest, that collective national breath we took, still matters because the structures of violence that brought it to the fore remain with us.\n\nIn death George Floyd did more than join a litany of Black martyrs such as Emmett Till, killed at the altar of White supremacy. Viral images of Floyd's anguished last breaths and the sound of his calls for his momma forced Americans to confront some hard truths about our past. 2020's summer of racial justice protests also served as a global touchstone that offered lessons about the way in which concepts of police brutality, racial disparities connected to the pandemic, public school segregation and White privilege were all rooted in America's original sin of chattel slavery.\n\nSuddenly Black history mattered in ways that were vital to our national interest. Business, civic and corporate leaders scrambled to organize webinars that might explain the protests to their employees and leadership teams. The \"1619 Project,\" a Pulitzer Prize winning multimedia investigation of slavery's panoramic tentacles in American life over four centuries, took on new political and democratic significance.\n\nThe visible strength of Black voters changed the trajectory of the Republican Party too. The GOP's fealty to Trump's \"Big Lie\" about election fraud can be traced back to growing unease regarding the ability of BLM protests to organize and activate a broad multiracial and multigenerational coalition of voters -- let's call them the George Floyd and Breonna Taylor generation -- to not only defeat the president but to permanently reshape American politics.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death helped to accelerate the evolution of America's Third Reconstruction. And just like the backlash faced after racial slavery and the challenges endured during the Second Reconstruction (the modern civil rights era) and the first (in the years following the Civil War when Black people got elected to office and started to legislate their own post-slavery new deal before being disenfranchised by Jim Crow), we face continuous assaults on Black voting rights, resistance to telling the truth about American history and political roadblocks to efforts to achieve reparations for the wealth that has been plundered from the African American community.\n\nSome of the most hopeful aspects of the year since Floyd's murder are visible in the growing realization of tens of millions of Americans of their own personal and political power. The Biden administration's focus on racial equity in the passing of the pandemic relief bill, the organization of the Justice Department, executive orders and public pronouncements following the guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial all reflect the power of Black grassroots insurgency in the wake of Floyd's death. President Joe Biden's willingness to address racism from the national bully pulpit offers an important exemplar of how our nation might take the lead in centering racial justice in domestic and foreign policy.\n\nDemocracy remains imperiled so long as Black lives in America are -- as they remain today -- marginalized, segregated and subject to mass incarceration and premature death. The Republican Party has unleashed over 360 voter suppression bills designed to thwart Black votes and suffocate democracy in favor of \"redeeming\" states that voted Democratic in a manner that echoes the Black Codes of yesteryear. The GOP's efforts to cancel a commission to investigate the White supremacist riot at the capital on January 6 of this year reflect an organized effort to hide from our present historical and political realities. So much of our national political divide is based upon an inability to squarely confront the ugly parts of American history.\n\nOne year after the summer of racial and political reckoning we seem intent on following the same wrong path as previous generations. But if the response to George Floyd's murder illustrated anything, it is that another world is possible.\n\nWe can pass a John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act that honors the legacy of the civil rights generations while ensuring fair ballot access to subsequent ones. Honoring George Floyd's legacy continues with grassroots efforts to reimagine public safety by investing in non-lethal responders to housing insecurity, mental health challenges and traffic stops. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a major federal effort on this behalf, but the work continues until no Black person is unjustly killed by law enforcement.\n\nThe political fate of these measures remains uncertain. And yet, America is less of a fixed destination than a constantly evolving ideal, remade by successive generations, most of whom seek love more than perfection. The George Floyd and Breonna Taylor Generation that massed on the streets of America and around the world last year modeled the path we can all still choose to take to move forward, by bearing witness to both the presence of injustice and our collective power to shape a new world.",

And just like the backlash faced after racial slavery and the challenges endured during the Second Reconstruction (the modern civil rights era) and the first (in the years following the Civil War when Black people got elected to office and started to legislate their own post-slavery new deal before being disenfranchised by Jim Crow), we face continuous assaults on Black voting rights, resistance to telling the truth about American history and political roadblocks to efforts to achieve reparations for the wealth that has been plundered from the African American community.",

            "content": "Ever broken a bone? You know your first thought: \"Ouch!\"\n\nBut what if said health care worker was too busy asking about your gender identity instead of focusing on mending your broken bone? Sure, it's important to record and review medical history, but why would questions about hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery be relevant in that case?\n\nIt\u2019s when a health care provider \u2013 consciously or not \u2013 assumes all manner of medical issues are a result of a person being trans.\n\nTransgender people require equitable health care just like anyone else \u2013 and experts advise using all the tools in the trans community's arsenal to fight discrimination.\n\nDouglas Knutson, Oklahoma State University assistant professor in counseling and counseling psychology, co-authored a paper for the Journal of Research on Women and Gender in 2016 called \"'Trans broken arm': Health care stories from transgender people in rural areas.\"\n\nWhen he started researching mental and physical health care access for trans and nonbinary people, he discovered individuals seeking treatment faced negative experiences, particularly in rural areas.\n\n\"I think at its core, trans broken arm is about not allowing trans people to be people,\" he says.\n\n'Tears of joy':Mj Rodriguez the first trans performer nominated for lead drama Emmy\n\nPaula Neira, board secretary of Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality, puts it this way: \"Whether I have a penis or a vagina doesn't matter because I'm here for a broken arm because somebody kicked me in the arm.\"\n\nSuch biases could have deadly consequences, according to D. Ojeda, health policy advocate for the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\n\"These biases impact the ability for a provider to identify serious medical conditions before it becomes too late,\" Ojeda says. \"And unfortunately, even sometimes fatal because they aren't able to identify it based on their biases.\"\n\nSomething cisgender people forget \u2013 likely because they've never juggled feelings of gender dysphoria \u2013 is that \"being transgender is not a medical condition,\" Persephone Rose, a 28-year-old nonbinary transgender woman says. It's only something that you can discover for yourself.\n\nInvesigation:Conservatives want to ban transgender athletes from girls sports. Their evidence is shaky.\n\n'Pose' is over. What\u2019s the future for transgender representation on TV?\n\nThe hurdles trans and nonbinary people face when seeking health care\n\nRose, who lives in the Washington, D.C., area, says their family was not supportive when they came out in 2005.\n\n\"Trans people were not in the news so much,\" they say (Rose uses she and they pronouns interchangeably), recalling their teenage years.\n\nRose first transitioned when she turned 18, though later de-transitioned for six years. Living as a trans woman, between housing and employment discrimination, grew too stressful on top of medical care.\n\nDoctor's visits turned triggering. She would go for an MRI only for them to ask about her last period \u2013 then have to reveal she never has periods because she, um, doesn't have a uterus.\n\n\"We got to a point where my medical records were really weird because I felt like I had to make up (expletive) in order to even get unrelated work done,\" she says.\n\nSeeing more trans visibility in media instilled in her the courage to once again transition.\n\nRose began using boutique preventative health care company Forward Health before her second transition. She felt comforted with the fact the company could accommodate transgender patients. Her physician, Dr. Laura Billiet, introduced herself with her pronouns, which Rose saw as trans care competency.\n\nRose could finally deal with other aspects of her health without her trans identity stealing the attention.\n\nPreviously, \"this would follow me around, all the time in any sort of health care situation,\" she says. \"And it discounted my ability to advocate for myself because it was always seen as that must be the problem. It must be because you're on these medications, or because you've had these medications or your issues must be related to your lifestyle.\"\n\nWhen Forward began assisting with filling prescriptions at the pharmacy, \"it felt kind of like having superpowers.\"\n\nIncredible:Elliot Page came out as transgender. Here's what that means for young trans people.\n\nNeira says she's had to spend a lot of time educating her own providers about transgender health care \u2013 though she's in a more privileged position than most, being the clinical program director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Transgender Health and Navy veteran.\n\n\"Picking that fight with me is a really dumb idea,\" she says.\n\nTransgender women of color are the most likely to be discriminated against across society, and health care is no different, according to Neira.\n\nWashington, D.C., transgender couple Ahanu and Petrona faced discrimination from the health care system during Ahanu's pregnancy \u2013 and specifically at the 20-week ultrasound for their then-unborn child. The hospital thought Petrona was pregnant, not Ahanu \u2013 likely because of assumptions about gender presentation.\n\nThey ultimately sought out a midwife and delivered the baby at home. Both are indigenous \u2013 Ahanu is Kainai, of Canada, and Petrona is Nawat, of Kuskatan and Lenca descent, of Central America \u2013 and two-spirit, aka someone who is a Native member of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe pair have shared their story on the most recent season of Facebook Watch series \"9 Months with Courteney Cox.\"\n\nBoth have received vitriol as the series has aired, with Petrona now the focus of right-wing media attacks for her inducing lactation practices.\n\nIn case you missed:We need to celebrate LGBTQ joy this Pride Month. Lives depend on it.\n\nWhat trans and nonbinary people can do to protect themselves\n\u2022 Seek answers from the community. The more that an individual can connect with fellow members of the transgender community and share information about who you should go to for doctor's appointments versus who you should avoid is crucial, Knutson says.\n\u2022 You are allowed to fire your doctor or not take their advice. \"A part of knowing when and how to do that is about connecting with community members who have navigated those systems and can speak with wisdom and insight into those things,\" Knutson says.\n\u2022 Don't let your health care provider discriminate. It's against the law. \"It is a legal obligation to not discriminate against trans people, and that would include being willing to provide this care even if it's not something you've done before,\" Noah Lewis, director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund's Trans Health Project says. Visit the Trans Health Project for more resources \u2013 and know the same goes for denied insurance coverage, too.\n\u2022 Be prepared for discouragement \u2013 and bring backup. Lack of awareness still reigns supreme, Lewis says. Steeling yourself ahead of time isn't a bad idea. Also, invite a loved one with you for extra support, and even call ahead to see if the provider has experience working with transgender patients.\n\u2022 Document everything. If a provider refuses to treat you and dismisses your concerns, demand they document as such in your electronic health record. It could make them more responsive and serve as a form of protection if you need to build a legal case, Ojeda says.\n\nCheck it out:LGBTQ definitions every good ally should know\n\nHmm:Could coming out as LGBTQ be over someday?\n\nWhat medical professionals should know\n\u2022 Ask for people's pronouns. That shows respect for people and their preferences, according to Billiet. Listen and be respectful. \"I know that sounds really obvious, but unfortunately, it's less common than it really should be,\" Billiet says.\n\u2022 Self-educate. Articles and research can only tell you so much. Go on YouTube, visit community events and meet people with these identities, Knutson says. Many continuing education opportunities exist for all kinds of specialties. \"There's really no excuse not to be able to learn this material,\" Lewis says.\n\nCongratulations!

This May \u2014 20 months after Hurricane Dorian unleashed its cruelty upon my Bahamas \u2014 I looked down from an airplane\u2019s window and could see land that was still visibly wounded. Grand Bahama and the Abacos were once covered in dark green foliage that complemented the emerald waters; now long stretches had faded to brown, even gray. Two-story waves had blown apart wide sections of shoreline. Once-gorgeous mangrove swamps \u2014 habitat for algae and crabs and bonefish, and the land\u2019s defense against a storm\u2019s surge \u2014 were overwhelmed by Dorian\u2019s salt water, and large swaths of them lay dead, their brittle shells shimmering in the heat. The same fate befell the abundant indigenous Caribbean pine trees, which take decades to grow to their towering heights of over 100 feet. They need fresh water to survive, so when the ocean stretched upon the land and sat there for days, it killed acres of them. Interspersed between the dead mangroves and fields of mangled bark I would find still-marred neighborhoods. Concrete toppled. Roofs missing. Debris scattered. Some blocks looked akin to the aftermath of rapture: Those taken were not taken gently, and those granted enough mercy to survive had stories so harrowing they approached the point of legend. One man was flung high into a massive gum tree and remained there until rescue arrived. Another man and his son, almost swept away by the flood, managed to hang on to the trunk of a pine. By the end of the storm, they had no skin left on their arms.\n\nEvery time I have returned home to the Bahamas since the storm, I\u2019ve also stopped by what remains of my uncle\u2019s house. My mother was living there when Dorian began to worsen off the coast. Having been through many hurricanes, she decided to shelter in place. But her sisters had awful premonitions of danger and begged her to come to Nassau. Eventually she relented and, for the first time in her life, retreated from a hurricane. She turned out to be incredibly lucky: Dorian intensified rapidly just before landfall, and the house was thoroughly ransacked. Its windows and doors were blasted open, and much of what had been on the inside was in pieces on the outside. The roof survived, but the refrigerator was dangling among the support beams, having floated up into the ceiling and never descended. If my mother had remained there, we might never have found her. Before my mother, before Bahamians, before the colonizers and the enslaved people they dragged here, it was in large part the Indigenous Ta\u00edno who cultivated the lands. They believed hurricanes arrived because of the powers of the zemis, or divine deities. The Ta\u00edno feared and respected these zemis, whose powers often devastated Ta\u00edno communities. To survive, they sheltered in sturdy structures when storms came, praying to be spared. European colonizers, before killing nearly all the Ta\u00edno, took note of these strategies \u2014 knowledge passed down across the time of colonization that serves as a basis for Bahamians today.\n\nKatharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, once said that the question with any given hurricane is not \u201cWas it caused by climate change?\u201d but rather \u201cHow much worse did climate change make it?\u201d Hurricanes are seen as the Earth\u2019s mechanism for ferrying excess heat from the Equator toward the poles. With the average surface temperature of the planet\u2019s oceans having increased nearly one degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, there is now more heat in the tropics, and so the planet\u2019s transfer of that heat has become more powerful; the storms quicker to intensify and the lives of those in their paths more precarious. Even small increases in hurricane strength can have catastrophic effects. According to the United States National Weather Service, doubling wind speed from 75 to 150 miles per hour can equate to 256 times more damage potential. And while the strongest hurricanes in the Bahamas\u2019 history once topped out at 160-mile-per-hour sustained wind speeds, Dorian\u2019s was 185 \u2014 a difference that, per the same scale, means more than three times the damage power. For Bahamians, only a handful of miles per hour seem to span the difference between tearing down power lines and tearing up concrete. The consequences are immense. The damage Dorian inflicted on the Bahamas was estimated at $3.4 billion \u2014 about one-fourth of the country\u2019s 2019 gross domestic product, and almost six times the damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, formerly the costliest storm the country had faced in the past 30 years. Historically, hurricanes kill very few people in the Bahamas, but Dorian officially killed nearly 100, and hundreds more remain missing.\n\nThe Ta\u00edno believed that hurricanes were the consequences of choices made by beings outside their control. Today it\u2019s the intensifying strength of the hurricanes that is outside the control of Bahamians. It is the consequence of decisions made by wealthy nations beyond our shores, and the greenhouse gas emissions that have fueled their prosperity and way of life. Most of these gases have come from the United States, China, the European Union, Russia and other developed countries. Compared with them, the Bahamas\u2019 own emissions are tiny. And yet it is the Bahamas, along with other small islands worldwide \u2014 like Antigua and Barbuda, the Maldives, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands \u2014 that are on the front lines of the climate crisis. Given the long-known imbalance between those most culpable for climate change and those set to suffer most from it, the question of who should be held accountable for losses and damages is not a new one. It has been asked for three decades, and is even addressed in the Paris Agreement. The accord is thought to have three pillars. The first, \u201cMitigation,\u201d mandates that countries commit to doing what they can to keep the rise in global average temperature well below two degrees Celsius. The second, \u201cAdaptation,\u201d concerns the preparation of infrastructure and communities to survive changes in the climate. \u201cLoss and Damage\u201d is third. It seeks to build support for joint financing, commensurate with different economies\u2019 contributions to climate change, to address all the destruction of resources, homes, ecosystems and livelihoods that Mitigation and Adaptation cannot prevent.\n\nAt the 2015 conference in Paris, debate around Loss and Damage rose to a fever pitch. Developed countries, by and large, wanted to fold Loss and Damage mechanisms into the articles in the agreement regarding Adaptation, arguing that the two were coupled. Many developing countries believed they should be separate; some were already experiencing losses from climate change, and it seemed clear that even with profound adaptation, such injuries were now inevitable. \u201cWe mobilized very big-time, the climate-vulnerable forum countries, the least developed countries,\u201d Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, told me. \u201cIt became one of the make-or-break issues that took us into overtime on the last day in Paris.\u201d Toward the end of the conference, John Kerry, representing the Obama administration, met with Enele Sopoaga, who was then the chairman of A.O.S.I.S. and the prime minister of Tuvalu, a chain of low-lying Pacific islands. Throughout the conference, Sopoaga stressed his commitment to seeing A.O.S.I.S.\u2019s goals included in the agreement, saying, \u201cNobody is going to take them out now without a war.\u201d But in an interview after their meeting, Kerry told reporters that \u201cI explained exactly where we\u2019re coming from on that, and I think there\u2019s good understanding.\u201d The United States Congress, according to Kerry, would be rigidly against any implication of any nation\u2019s liability for climate damages elsewhere. And so, when the landmark Paris Agreement was successfully adopted at the end of the conference, Loss and Damage did win recognition as a stand-alone article in the agreement \u2014 but while the accords included the aim to \u201cenhance understanding, action and support\u201d for such damages, a caveat was added, explaining that the agreement \u201cdoes not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.\u201d After Dorian, a torrent of international aid began pouring into the Bahamas. To help manage recovery efforts, the government established a Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction \u2014 and, within that, the Disaster Reconstruction Authority. Over the 20 months since the storm, tens of millions of dollars have been spent on the islands\u2019 recovery from the worst disaster in their history. Fourteen schools have been repaired and more than three million cubic yards of debris cleared; funds have been delivered for small businesses and payments worth thousands awarded for homes in need of repair. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty pleased about the Small Home Repair Program,\u201d Katherine B. Smith, the managing director of the D.R.A., told me. The organization had helped about 2,600 people, and had another thousand approved and waiting. But, Smith said, there was still some way to go. Around 9,000 homes sustained damage during Dorian, and considerable debris still remains \u2014 all while the pandemic has paralyzed tourism, the Bahamas\u2019 most significant economic driver, and tied up the government\u2019s resources. When I asked Smith how much longer recovery efforts might take, given that we\u2019re approaching two years since the storm, she said the answer was \u201ca minimum of another two to three years. And that\u2019s based on all things being good.\u201d\n\nJacana Theoc and her family were left with only the shell of their home. \u201cWe figured we had more damage than anybody,\u201d she told me. But when the government assessed what was left of their property and offered assistance, the family didn\u2019t get as much as they expected. The Red Cross helped with food for a while, and social services provided some furniture and a few new appliances, but the house Theoc spent 10 years saving for remains boarded up and battered. The story was similar everywhere I went. In the High Rock area, where residents were still trying to rebuild, a woman with a measuring tape on her belt told me that while her community had lost many people in the storm, it had even more deaths in the aftermath. And Nadine Pinder, whose husband is pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, told me many seniors in her community were in special need of help: \u201cSome of them have lost their families. And the one thing you know you felt so secure in, which is your home, has now been taken away.\u201d Many residents had whole houses swallowed by the storm and were left with only foundations. For temporary shelter, the Bahamian government contracted for more than 100 white, igloo-like domes made of a fiberglass composite, part of a $6.4 million family relief package. I\u2019m told the domes leak, and have a tendency to get too warm and accumulate mold. A woman who lives in one (she asked to be referred to only as Zelma, worried about sounding ungrateful or jeopardizing future aid) told me she had been trying to rebuild her home with climate adaptation in mind. She\u2019s using concrete this time, instead of wood, despite the expense. Other than funding from the D.R.A. and previous help from the Red Cross, her family has to stretch her daughter\u2019s small salary to cover construction. They heard that an NGO, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, was still around, offering free roofs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on it, trying to get the house up to the belt course\u201d \u2014 the juncture at the top of a story \u2014 \u201cso we could get that roof,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t worked out.\u201d She shook her head for a while, holding it low. \u201cAnd hurricane season is right here again.\u201d Similarly, Ann Wilmore now lives in a government dome built atop the foundation where her house once was, on a vibrant bluff overlooking the Sea of Abaco. She looked to NGOs for help rebuilding, but many left the islands when the pandemic arrived. Most of those who remained told her they\u2019d depleted their resources, and for what they had left \u2014 windows, roofs, doors \u2014 \u201cthey told me I don\u2019t qualify because I lost the whole structure.\u201d When she went to the D.R.A., she was told they weren\u2019t taking new applications. (Smith, the program\u2019s managing director, told me earlier that the D.R.A. was looking to raise funds and partnerships to expand the Small Home Repairs Program, but until then its portal was scheduled to remain closed.) I watched Wilmore\u2019s eyes dart around her remaining foundation, the different tiles indicating what were once different rooms, and I could tell she was imagining the home that had stood there. When she threw open her hands, I could see the sea behind her. \u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t qualify?\u201d she said.\n\nSince the Paris Agreement, as the effects of climate change have worsened, the U.S. stance on Loss and Damage has remained the same. \u201cLoss and Damage is an existential issue for us,\u201d said an A.O.S.I.S. representative, the Belizean environment minister Omar Figueroa, at the most recent climate-change conference in 2019. \u201cWe need clear and predictable finance that we can access to really compensate for the loss and damage that so many of our sister nations are feeling.\u201d U.S. representatives, however, operating under the Trump administration, continued to refuse discussions of finance, and privately underscored that doing otherwise would \u201cpush the button of a certain man in the Oval Office.\u201d As a proposed workaround, some developed countries, like those of the European Union, have suggested tapping the Green Climate Fund, a pool made available for developing countries to help in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. But Harjeet Singh, a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International, told me this would deplete an already underfunded stream. \u201cLoss and damage occurs when you realize you have not done enough on mitigation and adaptation,\u201d he says. Finance, he says, remains a paramount issue. According to some economists, losses and damages from climate change are set to amount to somewhere between $290 billion and $580 billion a year by 2030. Currently there is no finance stream to meet those costs. \u201cThat means that money that should have gone to education, health care, infrastructure is now being diverted to emergency response and rehabilitation and reconstruction, which puts developing countries into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt,\u201d Singh says. \u201cFinance is something that really rich countries, particularly the U.S., have made sure that there is no progress and not even discussion on.\u201d On April 22, 2021, the Biden administration began a Leaders Summit on Climate \u2014 part of an attempt, after the Trump administration, to rescue the narrative of the United States\u2019 role in combating climate change. In his opening address, the president urged nations around the world to increase their ambition to curb emissions. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about climate justice, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that while every country was feeling the effects of climate change, \u201csome countries are experiencing much more severe impacts than others, something we must acknowledge and address.\u201d But they made no mention of developed countries rising to the call of accountability; they made no mention of Loss and Damage. On behalf of my Bahamas, I wish I could say that the world wasn\u2019t so inextricably connected. It would mean that as the planet continued to warm, Bahamians like my mother, like Jacana Theoc, Tyrone Mather and Ann Wilmore, would not be at such risk of having their entire lives lacerated. In a closed system, the carbon emissions from a small island state might change the climate at a rate proportional to their size. But the systems of this world are bewilderingly open, tangled across oceans and continents and nation-states, and so the cumulative carbon footprint of every country on the planet is coming to bear down on small islands. Some of us are disappearing as the oceans rise. Some are experiencing droughts. Some are facing storms that are swinging blades we can no longer parry. My Bahamas are facing effects of climate change that we could never have caused ourselves, and crises larger than we can survive alone. I am told that global climate conferences tend to take place at convention centers, in windowless rooms with strip lighting and air-conditioning. This means that global climate policies are negotiated in climates far more neutral than the ones they affect. But their stakes remain incredibly high. Because this year\u2019s conference, in November in Glasgow, will be the Biden administration\u2019s first, it has an excellent chance to raise its ambitions and finally allow a discussion about accountability to developing nations and small island states. There\u2019s no other way to achieve climate justice, and no other way our countries can survive.

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about climate justice, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that while every country was feeling the effects of climate change, \u201csome countries are experiencing much more severe impacts than others, something we must acknowledge and address.\u201d This means that global climate policies are negotiated in climates far more neutral than the ones they affect.",

            "description": "A Peru election focused on Keiko Fujimori, COVID-19, communism  Los Angeles Times",
            "content": "The country folk came to cheer their presidential candidate \u2014 Pedro Castillo, a teacher-turned-left-wing-populist lauded by supporters as a savior in hard times.\n\n\u201cWe want a man of the people, a campesino, a president for us all,\u201d said Maria Pinto, 45, a homemaker at a raucous pro-Castillo rally in this historic mountain town. \u201cPedro will return the country\u2019s wealth to the people.\u201d\n\nHis opponent fails to generate similar excitement. Keiko Fujimori, a two-time loser in presidential races and the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, the former president serving a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity, stands accused of taking bribes and laundering money.\n\nBut supporters, especially in the business class, battered during the pandemic, view her as a safer choice.\n\n\u201cWith COVID-19, tourism died, we were all thrown out of work, and we now need stability to come back,\u201d said Victor Hugo Quispe, who runs a tour company here and plans to cast his vote for Fujimori. \u201cThis is not a time for more uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe election Sunday featuring a pair of candidates from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum comes as many Peruvians are losing hope for their economy and their democracy.\n\nSix of the last seven presidents have either been forced from office amid allegations of wrongdoing or have faced charges upon completing their terms. The country had three different presidents in a week last November amid fierce street demonstrations against the dysfunctional political class.\n\nCOVID-19 brought a different kind of misery, hobbling the healthcare system, killing at least 184,000 of Peru\u2019s 32 million people \u2014 the highest death rate in the world \u2014 and shrinking the once-robust economy by 11.1 % last year. The World Bank estimates that 2 million people were driven into poverty.\n\n\u201cSo much of what we are seeing in this election comes down to the devastation of COVID-19,\u201d said Gustavo Gorriti, a well-known Peruvian journalist. \u201cThere was so much loss, so much suffering, both on a personal level and to the economy.\u201d\n\nPolls show a near draw as Fujimori cuts into the lead that Castillo held following his first-place finish in an initial round of balloting in April. She finished second. Each garnered fewer than 20% of the votes in a fragmented field of 18 candidates.\n\nThe contest has bared some of the geographic, socioeconomic and ethnic factors that divide the country.\n\nCastillo, 51, who has never held public office and was a political unknown before this year, draws much of his support from the poor, Indigenous population in the Andes. Fujimori, 46, who would become the country\u2019s first female president, runs stronger in the capital, Lima, and other coastal areas that have benefited from the longstanding export-oriented, free-market economic policies she has championed.\n\nA sense of uncertainty and foreboding precedes election day, as each campaign portrays the opposing candidate as an extremist \u2014 Castillo a communist and a terrorist who would scare off investors, Fujimori a thief and dictator-in-waiting.\n\nAdding to the tension was the massacre of 16 people last month in a remote jungle region known for illicit cultivation of coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.\n\nThe assailants left leaflets warning people not to vote June 6 and denouncing Fujimori supporters as \u201ctraitors.\u201d Authorities attributed the strike to remnants of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group, which waged a bloody insurgency against the government in the 1980s.\n\nAfter Alberto Fujimori became president in 1990 \u2014 a milestone for the tiny minority of Peruvians who trace their ancestry to Japanese immigrants \u2014 he made his reputation as a no-holds-barred foe of the insurgents. At one point, he dissolved Congress while alleging that legislators were blocking his efforts to fight terrorism and institute free-market economic reforms to tame hyper-inflation.\n\nHis style of rule became known as fujimorismo \u2014 assailed by critics as authoritarianism, but hailed by his daughter\u2019s backers as robust leadership.\n\n\u201cFujimori lifted Peru out of the economic crisis and at the same time defeated terrorism,\u201d said Carmen Mar\u00eda Carranza, 38, a marketing executive for a beauty-products firm. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t live through those years don\u2019t even know. But I saw how my parents suffered. \u2026 God save us from communism.\u201d\n\nIn 2009 \u2014 nine years after he resigned and Congress found that he was \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to serve \u2014 Fujimori was convicted of ordering a military squad to carry out a pair of massacres that left 25 dead while he was in office.\n\nThe unabashed champion of her 82-year-old father\u2019s checkered legacy, Keiko Fujimori has vowed to pardon him if elected.\n\nShe was just 19 when her parents separated in 1994 and her father made her first lady. After studying business administration in the United States, she was elected to the Peruvian Congress in 2006, proceeding to lose presidential runs in 2011 and 2016.\n\nIn March, after a two-year investigation, prosecutors charged her and associates with money laundering and corruption, most notably alleging that she received $1.2 million in bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht for her 2011 campaign.\n\nProsecutors called for the dissolution of her party, Popular Force, and recommended she be imprisoned for 30 years. A judge is reviewing the evidence.\n\nFujimori denies the charges and calls them a political hit job. She spent 13 months in detention on related charges in 2018 and 2019.\n\nBeing elected \u2014 with attendant presidential immunity \u2014 could keep Fujimori out of jail.\n\nFor his part, Castillo has vowed to eliminate corruption, a rallying cry for his base.\n\n\u201cPedro is for the people, Keiko is a criminal!\u201d chanted Juli\u00e1n Rojas, 40, a taxi driver who attended a Castillo rally recently in Lima\u2019s central Plaza San Mart\u00edn, where he helped hoist up an effigy of Keiko Fujimori in a mock jail cell and parade it around the square.\n\nCastillo, who dons a wide-brimmed peasant hat and plays up his rural roots, has said that he would rewrite the constitution to give more economic power to the government.\n\nThat would include raising taxes and royalties on Peru\u2019s crucial mining sector. He has accused multinationals of \u201cplundering\u201d the country\u2019s wealth of copper and other minerals.\n\nHis motto \u2014 \u201cNo more poor in a rich country\u201d \u2014 has resonated in the countryside and among the urban working class and fueled a torrent of criticism that he would turn Peru into the \u201cnext Venezuela.\u201d\n\nCastillo has vowed that he would protect private property and individual savings, and rejects any ideological affinity with Hugo Chavez, the late socialist leader whom critics hold responsible for economic ruin in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t communists, we aren\u2019t chavistas, we aren\u2019t terrorists,\u201d he told a crowd in April in the northern Peruvian city of M\u00e1ncora. \u201cWe are workers, just like any of you.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Fujimori has endeavored to soften her right-wing image, vowing to implement measures to help the poor \u2014 including raising the minimum wage, bolstering aid for students and pensioners, and providing \u201coxygen bonus\u201d grants of about $2,500 to each family that lost somebody to COVID-19.\n\nShe also recently conceded that she and her party had committed \u201cerrors\u201d and vowed to run a clean government.\n\nAmong Fujimori\u2019s improbable supporters are Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian Nobel laureate who lost the 1990 presidential election to her father and has been a scathing critic of both father and daughter. In a column for the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds, Vargas Llosa, a resident of Madrid, labeled Castillo a threat to democracy and called Keiko Fujimori \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, many have questioned her commitment to democracy, given her father\u2019s history and what critics call her hostility to criticism and free speech.\n\n\u201cI would never vote for the return of fujimorismo,\u201d wrote columnist Ernesto de la Jara in La Rep\u00fablica newspaper. \u201cTo vote for her would be to betray myself.\u201d\n\nFor many, there may be no good choice at the polls. Voting is mandatory for most, but it\u2019s unclear how much the pandemic will dampen turnout \u2014 or how many voters may file spoiled or blank ballots in rejection of both candidates.\n\n\u201cBoth Fujimori and Castillo and their parties have a lot of support, and both have unleashed a lot of passion, but both have also been discredited and rejected for many reasons,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist in Lima. \u201cFor many voters, especially in the middle classes, this election presents a difficult, even tragic moment.\u201d\n\nSpecial correspondent Adriana Le\u00f3n in Lima contributed to this report.",

            "title": "On Israel-Palestine, Biden Must Revive a Two-State Solution",
            "description": "On Israel-Palestine, Biden Must Revive a Two-State Solution  The New York Times",
            "content": "Lord knows, I sympathize with President Biden\u2019s desire to avoid getting dragged into mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the 11 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas made something crystal clear to me: Unless we preserve at least the potential of a two-state solution, the one-state reality that would emerge in its place won\u2019t just blow up Israel, the West Bank and Gaza; it could very well blow up the Democratic Party and every Jewish organization and synagogue in America. Yes, that\u2019s what I learned last week. I don\u2019t expect Biden to summon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to Camp David. As long as both are in power, no serious compromise is possible. But it is vital that Biden urgently take steps to re-energize the possibility of a two-state solution and give it at least some concrete diplomatic manifestation on the ground. Because without that horizon \u2014 without any viable hope of separating Israelis and Palestinians into two states for two peoples \u2014 the only outcome left will be one state in which the Israeli majority dominates and Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank will be systematically deprived of equal rights so that Israel can preserve its Jewish character. If that happens, the charge that Israel has become an apartheid-like entity will resonate and gain traction far and wide. The Democratic Party will be fractured. A rising chorus of progressives \u2014 who increasingly portray the Israeli army\u2019s treatment of Palestinians as equivalent to the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s treatment of Black people or to the treatment by colonial powers of Indigenous peoples \u2014 will insist on distancing the United States from Israel and, maybe, even lead to bans on arms sales.\n\nMeanwhile, centrist Democrats will push back that these progressives are incredibly na\u00efve, that they have no clue how many two-state peace plans the Palestinians have already rejected \u2014 which decimated the Israeli peace camp \u2014 and that none of their causes, from women\u2019s rights to L.G.B.T.Q. rights to religious pluralism, would last a minute on the Hamas-run campus of the Islamic University of Gaza. As the past two weeks demonstrated, every Jewish organization and synagogue in America will be heatedly divided over this question: Are you willing to defend a one-state Israel that is not even pretending to be a democracy anymore, a one-state Israel whose leaders prefer to rely on the uncritical support of evangelicals than the critical support of Jews? Finally, Jewish and non-Jewish students on every college campus also will be forced to wrestle with this question or run as far away as possible from the debate. More and more will abandon Israel. You can already see it happening. And anti-Semitism will flourish under the guise of anti-Zionism. It will get very ugly. All nuance will be lost. Twitter and Facebook will become battlefields between Israel\u2019s critics and defenders, and Donald Trump and the Republicans will fan the flames, telling American Jews that they have no future in the Democratic Party and beckoning them to come over to the G.O.P. \u2014 which, with its evangelical base, does indeed unquestioningly support the Jewish state \u2026 for now. \u201cPeople need to understand that this issue has been transformed in the past two weeks,\u2019\u2019 said Gidi Grinstein, the president of the Reut Group, a leading Israeli think tank. \u201cThe place of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict inside American society and politics \u2014 and inside the Jewish community \u2014 has morphed from a bipartisan issue to a wedge issue.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd it is a wedge issue now not only between Democrats and Republicans, he added, \u201cbut also between Democrats and Democrats. This is very bad news for Israel and for the Jewish people. Israel and Biden must urgently collaborate to defuse it.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, I hope that when the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, meets with Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week, he conveys a very clear message: \u201cFrom this day forward, we will be treating the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as a Palestinian state in the making, and we will be taking a series of diplomatic steps to concretize Palestinian statehood in order to preserve the viability of a two-state solution. We respect both of your concerns, but we are determined to move forward because the preservation of a two-state solution now is not only about your national security interests; it is about our national security interests in the Middle East. And it is about the political future of the centrist faction of the Democratic Party. So we all need to get this right.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor starters, Biden should reshape U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian relations by opening a diplomatic mission to the P.A. \u2014 as the nascent Palestinian state government \u2014 near its headquarters in Ramallah. At the same time, he should invite the P.A. to send a diplomatic representative to Washington as the would-be ambassador of a future Palestinian state. The Trump administration, spearheaded by its ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a rabid supporter of Jewish settlements across the West Bank, did something really reckless: It not only moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, without getting any Israeli concessions in return; it also closed the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem \u2014 which had long been the separate and distinct U.S. diplomatic link to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza. Trump just folded it into the Palestinian affairs unit in our embassy to Israel, reporting to the U.S. ambassador. This effectively wiped out any separate diplomatic representation of the United States to the P.A. Instead, Trump expanded the mandate of the U.S. ambassador to Israel to include the P.A. in the West Bank and Hamas-led Gaza. In other words, rather than having two embassies for two peoples, Trump created a one-state embassy, with a one-state ambassador, which together mirrored Israel\u2019s drift toward a one-state solution. By opening a U.S. diplomatic mission in Ramallah and not just East Jerusalem, Biden would be reversing that and reinforcing the P.A.\u2019s nascent state status. Second, Biden should propose negotiations on peace with Trump\u2019s plan as the starting point. It roughly proposed that Israel would get 30 percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians 70 percent, plus land swaps. Palestinians would have a capital outside Jerusalem. The plan was ridiculously lopsided in Israel\u2019s favor, and Palestinians rejected it outright. But the fact that Netanyahu accepted it makes it an effective starting point \u2014 not endpoint \u2014 for negotiations. It could also generate some G.O.P. support for Biden\u2019s two-state revival.\n\nThird, the U.S. should encourage the six Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel (Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates) to simultaneously move their embassies from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem \u2014 which all countries in the world recognize as part of Israel and which would make Israelis happy \u2014 and open embassies to the nascent Palestinian state in Ramallah, just like the United States. This, too, would reinforce the two-state reality, and Israel would find it very hard to oppose. Fourth, the U.S. should encourage these Arab states to massively increase their financial support to the Palestinian Authority and make help for Gaza conditional on aid flowing only through the P.A. \u2014 not directly to Hamas and not through international organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Again, as long as Netanyahu and Abbas are leading their respective entities, the prospects of concluding a two-state agreement are remote. But at least these steps would preserve the possibility of one down the road. Today, that is more important than ever \u2014 not just for Israelis and Palestinians but also for many Americans and Democratic Party lawmakers, for world Jewry and for Biden himself.

Therefore, I hope that when the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, meets with Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week, he conveys a very clear message: \u201cFrom this day forward, we will be treating the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as a Palestinian state in the making, and we will be taking a series of diplomatic steps to concretize Palestinian statehood in order to preserve the viability of a two-state solution. The Trump administration, spearheaded by its ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a rabid supporter of Jewish settlements across the West Bank, did something really reckless: Third, the U.S. should encourage the six Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel (Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates) to simultaneously move their embassies from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem \u2014 which all countries in the world recognize as part of Israel and which would make Israelis happy \u2014 and open embassies to the nascent Palestinian state in Ramallah, just like the United States.",

            "content": "Gehry Partners reestablished the vaulted walkway, left, a Guastavino-tiled corridor spanning the length of the main building, as a main access in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Piranesian switchback staircase, right, is Gehry\u2019s \u201conly concession to showiness,\u201d our critic says.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nNo billowing sails of glass or glimmering titanium in the renovation of the museum\u2019s Beaux-Arts home. Equally surprising are several new shows and the American galleries.\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 You know what\u2019s chicer than spending a ton on a landmark building? Spending a ton and barely showing it. When other museums and cultural institutions have turned to Frank Gehry, the Canadian Angeleno and 92-year-old grandmaster of torquing titanium, he has summoned up buildings both inventive and ostentatious: curves of metal at the Guggenheim Bilbao or Disney Hall in Los Angeles, or billowing sails of glass at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. But here in Philadelphia, where he was tasked to reimagine one of the country\u2019s oldest and most significant museums, he has left the stainless steel and the kinematics software at home. Fifteen whole years after the Philadelphia Museum of Art engaged Gehry for an expansion and renovation of its Beaux-Arts home at the top of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the first part of the work is complete \u2014 and discreet. His Core Project, as the museum calls it, has cleared out and reshaped the underground guts of its Greek Revival home to produce 20,000 additional square feet of galleries, along with a refreshed entrance and an atrium with potential for performances and gatherings in post-pandemic days. It\u2019s cost $233 million so far, and this is just part one; next will come additional new galleries underground, and a window puncturing the eastern staircase (you know, the one from \u201cRocky\u201d).\n\nYou\u2019ll see Gehry\u2019s hushed interventions first via the western entrance \u2014 which I still think of as the back of the museum, although it\u2019s been the primary access for years now. (The eastern entrance, off the parkway and up the steps, is closed for now.) It has more inviting glass doors and proper ramps for wheelchair access. The west lobby, called Lenfest Hall, has been given larger windows, and been denuded of the postmodern ticket booths designed by the museum\u2019s previous architects, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. The lobby\u2019s east wall has been torn down, and an auditorium has been ripped out to make way for a new central atrium, clad in the same honey-toned limestone that the museum\u2019s initial architects used in 1928. Here you\u2019ll see Gehry\u2019s only concession to showiness, in the form of a Piranesian switchback staircase leading to the basement level. Even that is outshone, though, by the splendid vaulted walkway leading off from it, decked out in Guastavino tile and re-emerging after decades as back of house. (For the moment nothing is down here except a couple of sculptures, a gift shop, and a little cafe; the macchiato was pretty good.)\n\nOne floor up are the new galleries, whose design is satisfyingly boring \u2014 and really, it speaks volumes about museum buildings in the 25 years since Bilbao that we\u2019re now enraptured by architecture you barely notice. (Once Gehry and his ilk were feted as master builders on the covers of magazines; now everyone wants to be Lacaton & Vassal, whose ultra-discreet renovations won them this year\u2019s Pritzker Prize.) This surgical approach, though, was always Gehry\u2019s plan. \u201cIt\u2019d be a real challenge to do something that\u2019s virtually hidden, that could become spectacular,\u201d the architect told The New York Times in 2006, when the museum first brought him on. Spectacular is not the word I\u2019d use for what\u2019s resulted, but it\u2019s certainly smart. I\u2019ll take that any day.\n\nSaint-Gaudens\u2019s gilded Diana still lords over the main staircase, and Marcel Duchamp\u2019s enigmatic \u201c\u00c9tant Donn\u00e9s\u201d still invites peepers to its wooden door. Thomas Eakins\u2019s \u201cThe Gross Clinic,\u201d that bloody masterpiece, is here currently \u2014 the museum shares it with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. The handsome rotunda in the modern wing still holds C\u00e9zanne\u2019s final and largest \u201cBathers,\u201d though I gravitate to \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama\u201d: hands down the greatest painting of the American Civil War, which reinvented maritime painting as an up-to-the-minute, trans-Atlantic media event. Of two large temporary exhibitions, the more important is \u201cSenga Nengudi: Topologies,\u201d a survey of one of the most accomplished figures of American post-minimal sculpture and performance. (It was organized by the Lenbachhaus in Munich; it was seen there in 2019 and has also toured to S\u00e3o Paulo and Denver.) After study in Los Angeles and Tokyo, and early experiments with fluid-filled plastic, Nengudi in 1975 began creating sculpture from used pantyhose, sometimes shaped by internal wires. Some stretch to the ceiling, pulled seemingly to their limits; some sag under the weight of sand, and recall breasts or stones or tumors.\n\nThese fragile and provisional sculptures, known collectively as the \u201cR.S.V.P.\u201d series, are rare to see in such numbers; that alone makes this show an event. Their impact also resides in associated performances, primarily by the artist Maren Hassinger, who would entangle her body in the elastic fabric, as if the sculpture was another dancer, broken but reanimated. In this show you\u2019ll see both early photographic documentation, a recent video of Hassinger dancing with Nengudi\u2019s sculptures, as well as a bank of TV monitors of other performances Nengudi and her colleagues did at Just Above Midtown, the pioneering Black-owned gallery in New York.\n\nMost surprising are the new American galleries, devoted to art from the colonial period to the Civil War. At least in visual terms, they look great. Colored walls display to advantage the museum\u2019s deep collection of Charles Willson Peale and other American painters. There\u2019s a rich display of Spanish colonial art, and an illuminating gallery of Philadelphia\u2019s free Black clockmakers, porcelain makers and silversmiths. Interpretively, there\u2019s still a way to go. New wall texts underscore the Black and Indigenous presence in Pennsylvanian society, as well as the presence of slavery in a region that likes to think of itself as more enlightened than the rest of America. (Not without some cause: In 1790 there were seven times as many slaves in New York as in Pennsylvania.) But it does so with an extreme focus on individual biography, canceling each portrait\u2019s subject for his or her personal evil, and hyping other objects for any imputed connection to servitude.\n\nThe text accompanying an 18th-century silver bowl, for instance, tells us nothing about the bowl, nothing about the market for silver, but all about the silversmith, one John Hastier, and his enslaved artisan, called Jasper. \u201cPerhaps Jasper created this bowl,\u201d the panel muses. Sure, I don\u2019t know, perhaps! But who created this one bowl is hardly as important as the political and economic institutions that sustained its creation, and the aesthetic forms that connect it to other times and places and cultures. Right now all we get is new, moralistic language sprinkled upon the same old story \u2014 and by the way, applying that language exclusively to American history can only be called myopic. In these same galleries, to take just one example, I saw a charger emblazoned with the insignia of the Dutch East India Company, which instituted slavery on multiple continents; this passes with no comment at all.\n\nIt\u2019ll take more time for the museum \u2014 for all our museums, really \u2014 to forge an approach that puts these objects in new relations, rather than appending them with asterisks indicating who was a nice person and who was a mean one. It\u2019s hardly impossible! It just means treating objects and images as more than a biographical record, but as vectors in a grand and global network of images and ideas. If we\u2019re talking about institutions stained by colonial legacies, universal museums rank pretty high on the list of malefactors \u2014 but who knows what new routes and sightlines you can contrive with the right renovation?

It\u2019s cost $233 million so far, and this is just part one; next will come additional new galleries underground, and a window puncturing the eastern staircase (you know, the one from \u201cRocky\u201d). really, it speaks volumes about museum buildings in the 25 years since Bilbao that we\u2019re now enraptured by architecture you barely notice.

            "content": "To understand the path of wine in the 21st century, consider a bottle of Txakolina. Twenty years ago, Txakolina was virtually unknown outside Spanish Basque Country, where it was the go-to wine with just about anything consumed at a table. Even in the rest of Spain, it was hard to find. Now, people all over the world have a passing familiarity with this often mildly effervescent wine, even if they don\u2019t know how to pronounce it (chock-oh-LEE-nah). Here at Wine School, where we have been exploring Txakolina over the last month, readers in Japan, Britain, Brazil, Italy, Switzerland and all over the United States weighed in with fond memories of a fizzy wine they once tasted in Basque Country and were delighted to be able to find closer to their homes. This wine evolution, from local to global, has been repeated endlessly in the first part of this century. Whether gr\u00fcner veltliner, assyrtiko, Jura or Etna, just to name a few examples beyond Txakolina, these wines have traveled a similar route to worldwide popularity.\n\nBy popularity, I don\u2019t mean volume of sales. None of these wines will ever compete with brands that are produced by the millions of bottles each year. They are not mass-market. Nor will they ever achieve the status of a chardonnay or pinot noir, popular grapes that become generic synonyms for a glass of white or red. Instead, wines like Txakolina are embraced by smaller groups of discriminating enthusiasts around the world, people who love wine and are curious enough to explore wines made from unfamiliar grapes or from little-known regions. It doesn\u2019t get much more unfamiliar than Getariako Txakolina, the Basque rendering of the appellation centered on the town of Getaria. The wine is sometimes called Txakoli, or written in Castilian as Chacol\u00ed. What\u2019s more, the principal grape for Getariako Txakolina, one of three Txakolina appellations, is hondarribi zuri, a white grape so mystifying that ampelographers cannot agree on its identity. \u201cWine Grapes,\u201d the authoritative guide by Jancis Robinson, Julia Harding and Jos\u00e9 Vouillamoz, asserts that hondarribi zuri can actually mean one of three different grapes: courbu blanc, crouchen or noah, an obscure hybrid. Hondarribi beltza, the local red grape, has no such issues with its lineage. Such a wine does not catch on easily. Word of mouth has certainly contributed to a rising awareness, through sommeliers, retail shops and wine publications that have exalted little-known wines like Txakolina. But for an obscure wine to gain traction in the United States, it often requires a tireless importer, too, willing to do the brick-by-brick work necessary to create a market.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Tamers of De Maison Selections in Chapel Hill, N.C., was not the first American importer to work with Txakolina. But he was the most energetic. In the early 2000s, he detected a need in the market for a wine like Txakolina and worked to introduce Americans to these wines. \u201cThey\u2019re simple, they\u2019re fresh, they\u2019re easy, and I think that people are starved for something like that,\u201d Mr. Tamers told me in 2010. From 2001 to 2009, sales grew from about 12,000 bottles exported to the United States to more than 111,000 bottles. By 2019, according to Wines From Spain, a trade organization, exports had more than doubled again, to almost 230,000 bottles. Current sales of Mr. Tamers\u2019s brands \u2014 he now imports the wines of four producers \u2014 are four-and-a-half times what they were in 2010. \u201cIt has never been as popular as today throughout the United States,\u201d he told me in May. As usual I suggested three bottles to try: Antxiola Getariako Txakolina 2020; Ulacia Getariako Txakolina 2019 and Ameztoi Getariako Txakolina 2020, which is among Mr. Tamer\u2019s producers. The first thing to know is that these are ocean wines. It\u2019s tempting to lump in Txakolina with relaxed, summery seaside wines from the south of France, Italy or Greece. But these are different, with little of the casual geniality that might characterize the wines of the Mediterranean. They come instead from the vicinity of the chilly, wind-swept Atlantic. Many of the grapes are grown practically within viewing distance of the Bay of Biscay, from which a breeze blows steadily, offering a kind of natural ventilation that helps prevent disease and mildew in a humid, rainy climate. You get a real sense of place with Getariako Txakolina. It\u2019s typically only 10.5 to 11.5 percent alcohol, with tangy acidity, and the wines are as bracing as a plunge into cold saltwater. Their flavor more closely resembles the aromas of the ocean air there, rather than any particular kind of fruit.\n\nThe Ameztoi was light and fresh. As several readers pointed out, these are not sparkling wines like Champagne or even p\u00e9tillant naturel. They simply have a light spritz, a bare effervescence that gives them energy and life. The Ameztoi was steely and stony, with faint herbal and citrus undertones. I found it joyous to drink. The Antxiola was similarly light, vivacious and stony, with a suggestion of lime zest and a refreshing bitter note as I swallowed. Both of these bottles were 2020s. The Ulacia was one year older, yet, if anything, it was a bit more effervescent and lively than the other two, though maybe less angular with rounder flavors of citrus and green apple. Did the extra year make a difference? Most authorities recommend drinking Txakolina as young as possible. I\u2019ve followed that guideline, though I confess I have no evidence of its truth, nor much experience drinking older Txakolinas. But one reader, Ken of Frankfurt, reported being invited to a tasting of aged Txakolinas one night in San Sebasti\u00e1n, a city renowned for its Basque gastronomy. \u201cFor those who love the fresh lighthearted experience of a Txakoli on a summer\u2019s eve, this is something else,\u201d he said. \u201cRich, deep and smooth, like a well-aged Mosel, it left us longing for more.\u201d Another reader, Nancy of Minnesota, said she had recently become obsessed with Txakolina, which she described as \u201cin between sparkling and still.\u201d She\u2019s right. While some might assume that Txakolina represents an age-old tradition in Basque Country, it\u2019s actually a modern wine, a product mostly of the 1960s when the Basque government lavishly subsidized vineyards and wine producers in an effort to prevent citizens from abandoning the countryside for the cities.\n\nUnlike the small estates that have been making wine for generations, most Txakolina producers are high-tech operations. Not all strive for quality, but the best work meticulously, hand-harvesting the grapes and fermenting with indigenous yeast. Generally, fermentation takes place in big steel tanks that are blanketed with nitrogen, an inert gas that preserves freshness and prevents oxidation. The nitrogen also prevents carbon dioxide, a byproduct of fermentation, from escaping, resulting in that gentle effervescence. Several readers said they have found the wine singularly transporting. Simone in Colorado said that drinking it brings her directly to San Sebasti\u00e1n. Joon Song of Los Angeles said it not only takes him to Spain but to Berkeley, Calif., where he said he first drank it 15 years ago. Garrett H. of Tokyo took issue with my suggestion that in Basque Country, people drink Txakolina with just about anything. He suggested that it was better suited for aperitifs, switching to other wines with the meal. That was not at all my experience in Basque Country. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Max de Zarobe, with his partner, Virginie Saverys, is a proprietor of Avignonesi in the Montepulciano region of Tuscany. Max is also Basque and has strong feelings about Txakolina. \u201cWe sometimes pair a suckling lamb with this wine; its acidity rinses out a milky fat that has not yet experienced the greenness of the grass,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut in the hearts of all Basques, a truth slumbers: pairing percebes and Txakoli is the marriage of reason and love.\u201d Percebes? Better known in English as gooseneck barnacles, these crustaceans are highly popular in Northern Spain and Portugal though rarely seen in the United States. And Mr. de Zarobe is correct: It\u2019s a great pairing.",

Instead, wines like Txakolina are embraced by smaller groups of discriminating enthusiasts around the world, people who love wine and are curious enough to explore wines made from unfamiliar grapes or from little-known regions. As usual I suggested three bottles to try: Antxiola Getariako Txakolina 2020; Ulacia Getariako Txakolina 2019 and Ameztoi Getariako Txakolina 2020, which is among Mr. Tamer\u2019s producers. While some might assume that Txakolina represents an age-old tradition in Basque Country, it\u2019s actually a modern wine, a product mostly of the 1960s when the Basque government lavishly subsidized vineyards and wine producers in an effort to prevent citizens from abandoning the countryside for the cities.",

            "content": "Mr. Scahill is an investigative journalist who has extensively reported on the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the author of \u201cBlackwater: The Rise of the World\u2019s Most Powerful Mercenary Army.\u201d\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWhen Joe Biden assumed the presidency in January, he embarked on a mission to reverse a slew of policies put in place by former President Donald Trump while leaving untouched the elite foreign policy consensus. Mr. Biden issued 42 executive orders in his first 100 days \u2014 more than than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 and has waged a methodical campaign against Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. With one major exception: Afghanistan. Beginning with his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Trump railed against America\u2019s forever wars and pledged to bring American troops home and to get out of Afghanistan. Despite his rhetoric, Mr. Trump vacillated between winding down some Obama-era lethal U.S. campaigns (in Pakistan and Libya) and expanding others (in Syria, Somalia and Yemen). He loosened the dubious Obama-era restrictions on killing civilians in airstrikes after suggesting, when he was a candidate, that the United States should kill the families of suspected terrorists. He also reauthorized the C.I.A. to conduct drone operations after Barack Obama\u2019s administration shifted those powers to the Pentagon. Mr. Trump basked in his self-perceived glory when in April 2017 the United States dropped the 21,600-pound \u201cmother of all bombs,\u201d the most powerful nonnuclear weapon, on a village in Afghanistan. In 2019 alone, the United States carried out more than 2,400 airstrikes in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump made a serious, if clumsy and contradictory, attempt in the latter half of his term to make good on his promise to end the Afghanistan war. His administration struck a deal with the Taliban, offering an American commitment to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by May 2021 for a Taliban promise not to allow the country to be used by transnational terrorists.\n\nCongressional Democrats and a group of hawkish Republicans led by Representative Liz Cheney were intent on slow-walking the execution of the plan and sought to deny funding for U.S. troop reductions in Afghanistan. There are also indications that some Pentagon and intelligence officials tried to stymie the plan, perhaps hoping that Mr. Biden would scrap the deal and Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline for withdrawal. Mr. Biden announced that while he did not agree with all of the particulars of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan and timeline, he would move forward with them. \u201cIt is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself, but it was an agreement made by the United States government, and that means something,\u201d Mr. Biden said. His decision was a bold one. There are powerful voices among Washington insiders, including the former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, pushing for him to reverse course. A recent report from the congressionally commissioned Afghanistan Study Group also advised Mr. Biden against withdrawing U.S. troops. As Responsible Statecraft first reported, two of the group\u2019s co-chairs and a majority of its 12 other members have current or recent financial ties to defense contractors that profit from the proliferation of American wars. The Afghan government, aid organizations, corporations and other entities with an ongoing presence in Afghanistan rely on contractors for everything from logistics to security. In the post-9/11 wars, the number of contractors on the ground has consistently dwarfed that of uniformed military personnel. Mr. Biden may be officially ending the U.S. military\u2019s official involvement, but it is still unknown how many of these private sector forces will follow suit or continue in the gray zones that have riddled the landscape of America\u2019s forever wars. Even as the Pentagon says that it will withdraw its contractors, there are signs that the privatized aspects of the war may continue. The private security company Triple Canopy is hiring armed guards to operate at several sites in Afghanistan beyond the Sept. 11, 2021, withdrawal date announced by Mr. Biden. Its parent company, Constellis, also owns Academi, the most recent name for Blackwater, the notorious mercenary firm founded by Erik Prince.\n\nMr. Biden has made clear he is reserving the option to go back into Afghanistan if he determines it is in America\u2019s interest. The Pentagon, which refers to the withdrawal as a \u201cstrategic retrograde,\u201d said it intends to continue \u201cover the horizon\u201d operations in Afghanistan as the conventional withdrawal moves forward. In plain terms, this can mean anything from drone strikes and targeted counterterrorism missions to logistical support of Afghan military forces. In recent weeks, senior U.S. military commanders spoke of plans to keep Special Operations strike forces in the region to conduct find-fix-and-finish operations in Afghanistan against the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and the Taliban if they create problems and threaten U.S. interests and to redeploy if ordered. In the early 1980s, Mr. Biden supported opening the spigot for American aid to Pakistan to combat the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It was this conflict that helped incubate the rise of the Taliban and, to an extent, Al Qaeda. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Biden was a passionate supporter of the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. \u201cWas ever a war more justified than us going into Afghanistan?\u201d he said in 2006. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any war since World War II more justified.\u201d But as vice president in 2009, Mr. Biden argued against a large-scale surge in U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He wanted the United States to move away from a nation-building enterprise and to use C.I.A., Special Operations forces and drones to conduct targeted operations. He argued that such actions were more in line with the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force than an occupation. That measure, which was passed by Congress days after the 9/11 attacks, was intended to support the targeting of the perpetrators of the attacks. It has since been stretched by successive administrations to justify military actions outside declared war zones. In the end, Mr. Obama did both: He surged conventional military forces in Afghanistan and expanded the use of Special Operations teams, C.I.A. activities and drone strikes. And large numbers of Afghan civilians were killed in U.S. operations during his two terms in office. The current Afghanistan plan, as Mr. Biden has publicly described it, is similar to what he advocated in 2009, albeit with U.S. strike forces being positioned elsewhere in the region rather than inside Afghanistan. In addition to the considerable maritime options of the United States, the Pentagon is reportedly looking at bases in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to host U.S. forces. In a way, Mr. Biden\u2019s plan is an indictment of the Afghanistan policies of the Obama White House and raises a bigger question: What was the point of continuing the occupation all these years?\n\nThe Taliban control large swaths of territory in Afghanistan, and as vice president, Mr. Biden argued during the internal White House debate over surging troops in 2009 that the only sustainable solution in Afghanistan will require recognizing the Taliban as an indigenous political force. In a 2009 handwritten memo for Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden assessed the Taliban as not \u201can existential threat to the United States of America\u201d and said that \u201cit was against their interest\u201d to welcome Al Qaeda back to Afghanistan. Once the United States pulls out its conventional military forces, hawkish figures in the American security and foreign policy establishment will use every subsequent incident of Taliban violence to argue that withdrawal was a mistake. In his speech announcing the withdrawal, Mr. Biden seemed to understand this dynamic, and he offered a pre-emptory argument: \u201cWe cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result.\u201d For now, Mr. Biden deserves credit for continuing the course set by his deeply flawed predecessor and making the case to his supporters that the war must end. He must remain steadfast and end America\u2019s longest war.",

            "content": "Formerly enslaved people called the phase that followed the Civil War, and their emancipation, Jubilee. In doing so, they at once communicated the joy of freedom and knowingly invoked the authority of the Bible: jubilee as an Old Testament law commanding the end of slavery, redistribution of land and forgiveness of debts. The prophetic term was another name for the period more commonly known as Reconstruction. That attempt to usher in a more substantive democracy \u2014 racially egalitarian and responsive to its poorest citizens \u2014 was swiftly abandoned by the federal government and violently suppressed by Southern reactionaries. Reconstruction\u2019s sabotage still reverberates: in the dysfunction of our political system, in the endurance of white supremacy, in our ever-widening inequality. While the White House likes to trumpet good news about the economy\u2019s recovery from Covid-19, it\u2019s important to understand how unequal the recovery has been. From March 2020 to March 2021, America\u2019s billionaires increased their combined fortunes by over $1.3 trillion, according to an analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, while millions of families, particularly in working-class communities of color, either scraped by or fell further into arrears. The nonmortgage debt load of retirees has, on average, doubled; while eviction bans kept many families off the street, they did not stop back rent from piling up. Millions more people fell into medical debt during the pandemic, which experts warn may soon lead to a spike in personal bankruptcies. Instead of hawking a \u201crecovery\u201d that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, President Biden and his colleagues should help finish the work of Reconstruction. The time has come to revive the Jubilee \u2014 which in the modern era would mean the erasure of debts and a democratic rebalancing of power between regular people and elites.\n\nSince before this nation\u2019s founding, indebtedness has been useful to the powerful as both a source of profit and a tool of social control and racial domination. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s view is particularly revealing: While he fulminated against debt as an unjust encumbrance on posterity and argued for the termination of debts unpaid after \u201cnatural limits\u201d (which he took to be the span of a generation), he recommended wielding debt as a tool to dispossess Indigenous people, \u201cbecause we observe that when these debts get beyond what the individuals can pay, they become willing to lop them off by a cession of lands.\u201d After slavery\u2019s abolition, similar tactics were deployed to squelch hopes for Jubilee. Sharecropping and tenant farming arrangements used debt to secure white landlords generations of exploitable labor, ensuring Reconstruction would remain undone. Today, financial predators, aided by allies in Washington from both parties, target borrowers who come from marginalized backgrounds, lack intergenerational wealth and face wage discrimination on the job, ensuring lifetimes of repayment while compounding social inequities and racial disparities. The rich, meanwhile, can use credit to their advantage: Individuals walk away from their obligations (Donald Trump, the self-professed \u201cking of debt,\u201d epitomizes this warped paradigm), and companies engage in strategic defaults. The same ethos informed the first Covid relief package. Congress stabilized the corporate debt market and offered companies forgivable loans (it even aided payday lenders and debt collectors that were previously fined by regulators) but failed to extend equivalent generosity to regular borrowers, who instead received inadequate payment pauses and cash assistance. Even this support was a circuitous bailout for creditors, given that people spent much of what they received to pay down debts. (Debt collectors could garnish people\u2019s third stimulus checks.)\n\nWhereas the American dream used to be owning a home with a white picket fence, now it is getting out of debt. For many, the humble aspiration of owing zero dollars seems out of reach. Over his long career, Mr. Biden has contributed to this crisis by working to strengthen the hands of creditors, including through a 2005 bankruptcy reform bill that rolled back protections for borrowers. The time has come to make amends. If the Biden administration is serious about \u201cbuild back better,\u201d it needs to take bold action. This country cannot afford to allow millions of struggling households to sink when mountains of old bills and back rent suddenly come due once payment pauses and eviction moratoriums end. The government can and must find ways to make crushing debt disappear. Student loans, medical debt, utility bills, criminal justice fines and fees, and municipal debt all need to be written down or canceled outright. I\u2019ve written elsewhere about some of the various legal means by which this can be accomplished, and many other potential strategies exist. To begin, Mr. Biden should honor his campaign promise for Congress to immediately cancel student debt for borrowers. There is no reason to hold back. Erasing every penny of federal student debt would improve nearly 45 million lives, help narrow the racial wealth gap and most likely win over a good number of Republican voters in advance of the midterms. The Debt Collective, a membership organization for debtors I helped found, has already drafted an executive order the president could sign tomorrow to do so \u2014 no need to involve Congress or pass legislation. Next, he should tackle medical debt. Following the lead of a proposal by Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrats could eliminate medical debt in collections, including fees incurred because of Covid. (At the very least, legislators should protect borrowers by ensuring that past-due hospital bills aren\u2019t reported on credit scores and make it harder for collectors to come after patients.) Finally, elected officials also need to relieve renters of the enormous burden they hold by canceling accumulated rent debt, preferably in a way that doesn\u2019t simply bail out and further enrich and empower landlords. Passing the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act introduced by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota would be a good start. These ideas are not outside the mainstream. Over 415 organizations, including the Minority Veterans of America, the National Young Farmers Coalition and the N.A.A.C.P., have signed a letter calling on the Biden administration to use executive authority to cancel student debt. In the early days of the pandemic, the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, a racial and economic justice group, introduced the Jubilee Platform, and it recently collaborated with progressive congressional legislators on a \u201cThird Reconstruction Resolution,\u201d both of which prominently feature debt relief.\n\nContrary to worries that letting debtors off the hook would sink the economy, there is evidence it would actually help keep it afloat by providing a much-needed financial boost. Freeing up money now spent on debt servicing to circulate more widely would increase demand, create jobs and encourage entrepreneurialism. A Jubilee would be a boon for everyone, even those who don\u2019t need direct assistance. But the effect would be farther-reaching than what can be measured by G.D.P. A Jubilee would help us reconstruct both our monetary economy and our moral one. A renegotiation of the social contract is long overdue. While the affluent shirk their obligations by refusing to pay taxes and living wages and then use the wealth they\u2019ve hoarded to fund politicians who protect their interests, poverty is shrouded in shame and stigma. But indebtedness is not a personal failing, and debtors are not to blame, which is why we should reject the language of \u201cdebt forgiveness\u201d and instead demand debt abolition, a phrase that pays homage to the concept of abolition democracy developed by the historian and activist W.E.B. Du Bois. \u201cAbolition democracy\u201d was Du Bois\u2019s name for what Reconstruction aspired to achieve \u2014 a process that would involve both the dismantling of racist institutions and the building of new egalitarian, cooperative political and economic relationships.

Student loans, medical debt, utility bills, criminal justice fines and fees, and municipal debt all need to be written down or canceled outright.",

            "description": "What Does \u2018Freedom\u2019 Really Mean?  The New York Times",
            "content": "Sebastian Junger embedded with a U.S. Army platoon in eastern Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008, and to judge from his work, he has been trying to find his way home ever since. He made two documentaries about the deployment, the terrific \u201cRestrepo\u201d and its sequel, \u201cKorengal,\u201d and wrote a book, \u201cWar\u201d (2010). Then he turned his focus to the weirdness of returning to the United States, both for soldiers and for war reporters, in a third documentary, \u201cThe Last Patrol,\u201d and laid out his passionate, counterintuitive ideas about post-traumatic stress disorder in a small but wide-ranging book, \u201cTribe\u201d (2016). The problem, he argued, wasn\u2019t old-fashioned shell shock in many cases; it wasn\u2019t medical at all, but existential \u2014 a loss of purpose. The brotherhood of combat forged a deep emotional connectedness that an atomized, uncomprehending America could not sustain. \u201cFreedom,\u201d Junger\u2019s latest book, begins in the middle of a mysterious pilgrimage: \u201cThe country opened up west of Harrisburg and suddenly we could drink from streams and build fires without getting caught and sleep pretty much anywhere we wanted. We\u2019d walked the railroad tracks from Washington to Baltimore to Philly and then turned west at the Main Line and made Amish country by winter.\u201d These lines have a lovely roll, the tone is heroic \u2014 they made Amish country by winter. But basic information is withheld, or only obliquely shared much, much later. Who are the members of this westbound party? What is their purpose? We are never told. But for those who have seen \u201cThe Last Patrol,\u201d which was released in 2014, things are clearer. It\u2019s about the same trek. Junger\u2019s companions, at least initially, are two of the soldiers from his time in Afghanistan, a Spanish photojournalist and war reporter, and a hulking black dog named Daisy. People speak, joke, have names; you see them walking, camping, playing with the dog. They talk to people they meet. Junger makes an effort to frame their project \u2014 \u201ca 300-mile conversation about war\u201d and why it\u2019s so hard to come home \u2014 which is more or less what happens in the film. That\u2019s not what happens in the book. Here, we pass through countryside, nearly all of it in south-central Pennsylvania, and don\u2019t hear a word from anyone till the second half. \u201cFreedom\u201d has a different purpose, a frame far less explicit. Afghanistan is scarcely mentioned, although the hikers, who are walking along the tracks illegally, do seem easily spooked. They\u2019re irrationally afraid of passing trains. They camp in defensive formation. \u201cI kept a knife in my boots, which were loosely laced so I could just drop my feet into them and run,\u201d Junger writes. That never becomes necessary. In fact, virtually nothing happens outside the author\u2019s head.\n\nThere are hymns to walking itself. There are rich descriptions of landscape, full of \u201cfloodwrack\u201d and \u201cquarrystone\u201d and \u201criverbend\u201d \u2014 I felt as if I were camping with Gerard Manley Hopkins. There are also epiphanies: \u201cThe things that had to happen out there were so clear and simple \u2014 eat, walk, hide, sleep \u2014 that just getting through the day felt like scripture: a true and honest accounting of everything that underlies the frantic performance of life.\u201d But the cleansing march disappears entirely for most of this short book. Junger takes us on long detours through history, anthropology, primatology, boxing, poker. It\u2019s not easy to follow the thread, although the main theme from \u201cTribe\u201d \u2014 extolling the superiority, both moral and psychological, of life in small nomadic groups (or small embattled platoons) over modernity under capitalism \u2014 appears repeatedly. The main thrust here, though, seems to be a ragged pursuit of the meaning of human freedom. The two topics overlap. \u201cFor most of human history, freedom had to be at least suffered for, if not died for, and that raised its value to something almost sacred,\u201d Junger writes. \u201cIn modern democracies, however, an ethos of public sacrifice is rarely needed because freedom and survival are more or less guaranteed.\u201d The nearly sacred version of freedom is often won or preserved, in Junger\u2019s view, through asymmetric warfare. The nomadic Scythians held off the mighty Persians; the Montenegrins outfought the Ottoman Empire. We get a 10-page account of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. Empires, of course, also win wars, and Junger\u2019s meditations on the American colonial frontier include the destruction of Indigenous civilizations by the conquistadors and the spirited, doomed resistance of the Apaches. The horrors of these conflicts are front and center. In Dublin, we note every last detail of the execution of the rebel leader Michael Mallin, including his heart-wrenching last letter to his wife and children. Is this gratuitous and invasive or is it illustrating a harsh truth about freedom? I found myself asking this question at many turns. Junger occasionally stumbles onto more humble, personal versions of his leitmotif. Frequently, he says, while he and his friends camped, \u201cwe were the only people in the world who knew where we were. There are many definitions of freedom but surely that is one of them.\u201d He recalls the exploits of Daniel Boone, which resonated with me \u2014 I myself wore a coonskin cap as a kid. But Junger sees little hope today for what he thinks of as freedom: \u201cMass societies \u2026 require such high levels of obedience that sometimes even their own citizens balk. Once you have spent years digging irrigation ditches or picking stones out of a wheat field \u2014 or working at a law firm \u2014 you have almost no leverage with which to insist on your autonomy, or anyone else\u2019s. The choice is to either rise up or submit, and many hardworking people understandably choose to submit.\u201d\n\nThese formulations \u2014 \u201crise up or submit,\u201d \u201cinsist on your autonomy\u201d \u2014 border on the jejune. Yes, we live in a world of laws, drudgery, interdependence. But we also live in a world rife with real injustice and, like any concept, freedom is always contextual. The Black majority in apartheid South Africa, the democratic opposition in Russia today, Americans fighting to expand voting rights: All have had to struggle toward a shared vision of freedom that is contingent, social, multivalent, modern. These meanings seem to fall outside Junger\u2019s investigation, although, to be fair, he does describe two industrial strikes in the early 20th century as episodes in the saga of the weak against the strong. I would have welcomed a discussion of the centuries-long dispute between the political left and right over the meaning of freedom. Does it pertain first to property rights or to human rights? \u201cFreedom\u201d has an authority problem. That is, its own authority is undercut by breathtaking generalizations and improbable mind-readings. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be much self-doubt among nomadic peoples,\u201d Junger writes. Or: \u201cAlthough wealthier and more stable, sedentary societies were often beset by an odd inferiority complex.\u201d Or: 18th-century frontiersmen settled their differences with fistfights, and \u201conce the fight was over, both men usually shook hands and forgot their differences.\u201d These contentions read like wild guesses or sentimental projections, and they reflect the book\u2019s structure, which feels both aimless and overdetermined. An afterword of sources and references lists a great many books and interviews, but it comes too late to solve the authority problem. The afterword also divulges a startling fact. \u201cThe trip was done in stages and not always with the same people,\u201d Junger confides. \u201cI write the account as if it were one long trip. Obviously, it was not.\u201d Well, he had me fooled, and this information carries a whiff of bad faith. I don\u2019t care how many months they took off or who was there when (we never know their names, anyway), but this thing is presented as an epic trek. We made Amish country by winter. On the last day of the journey, in an elegiac scene, Junger decides: \u201cThe trip was over. I was 51 years old, I had no children, I was in the process of getting a divorce.\u201d Junger has done great, meticulous reporting and narrative writing. Not here. \u201cIt was time to go home,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt was time to face my life.\u201d Sounds good.",

            "content": "Montgomery: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s $95 million lawsuit targeting comedian Sacha Baron Cohen filed after Moore complained he was tricked into an interview that lampooned sexual misconduct accusations against him. Judge John Cronan wrote that Moore signed a clear disclosure agreement that prohibited any legal claims over the appearance. He added that the absurd segment \u2013 in which the comic demonstrated a so-called pedophile detector that beeped when it got near Moore \u2013 was \u201cclearly a joke\u201d and that no viewer would think the comedian was making factual allegations against Moore. \u201cThe court agrees that Judge Moore\u2019s claims are barred by the unambiguous contractual language, which precludes the very causes of action he now brings,\u201d Cronan wrote. The lawsuit centered on Moore\u2019s unwitting appearance on the comic\u2019s \u201cWho is America?\u201d show. The segment ran after Moore faced misconduct accusations that he had pursued sexual and romantic relationships with teens when he was a man in his 30s. He has denied the allegations. Moore, a Republican sometimes known as the Ten Commandments judge known for hard-line stances opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the public display of Ten Commandments, faced the accusations during his 2017 Senate race.\n\nJuneau: More than 13 Indigenous communities, including seven in Alaska, will split $12 million for energy cost reduction efforts, officials announced. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm announced the grants during a teleconference Tuesday. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Keolani Booth, a Metlakatla Indian Community Tribal Council member, also participated in the event. They said the grant funds would help American Indian and Alaska Native communities reduce costs and move toward more sustainable energy production, the Juneau Empire reports. \u201cWe want to thank the federal government for its investment into our community,\u201d Booth said. \u201cThis opens up many new options.\u201d Metlakatla will use its grant of more than $1 million to complete an electrical intertie project to Ketchikan that is expected to lower prices. Booth, in a statement, said the project has been in the works for about 20 years and is becoming a reality because of the assistance of state and federal politicians. Other Alaska communities receiving grants are the Akiachak Native Community; the Native Village of Kipnuk; the Native Village of Diomede; the Native Village of Noatak and the Northwest Arctic Borough; the Village of Aniak; and the Village of Chefornak.\n\nPhoenix: A new energy facility scheduled to open in December southwest of the city will capture methane from cow manure and reuse the biogas as renewable natural fuel. Facility stakeholders said the process will capture harmful gases that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere and exacerbate climate change. The project is a partnership between West Virginia-based renewable energy company Avolta and the Butterfield Dairy Farm in Buckeye. Southwest Gas Holdings Inc. will help transport the gas for sale to other outlets. A handful of renewable natural gas facilities have sprouted up in the Southwest, including in Arizona and California in recent months. The Avolta facility is one of at least five renewable natural gas plants in or coming to Arizona. Others are expected to open in Tucson, Gila Bend and Maricopa. Unlike electric utilities in Arizona, which must generate 15% of their energy from renewable sources by 2025, Southwest Gas has no such required standard, according to the newspaper. Still, the gas utility is partnering with five facilities in Arizona and California. Spokespeople said the utility company is committed to partnering with more renewable natural gas developers.\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported its biggest one-day jump in COVID-19 cases in five months Tuesday as Arkansas held its dubious distinction of having the most new cases per capita in the country. The Department of Health said the state\u2019s cases rose by 1,476 to 358,949 since the pandemic began. It was the biggest one-day jump reported since Feb. 5\u2019s 1,824 cases. Arkansas\u2019 cases have continued to surge, fueled by the delta variant of the coronavirus and the state\u2019s low vaccination rates. The state ranks No. 1 in the nation for new daily cases by population, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Only 35% of the state\u2019s population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 41 to 606. Twenty-two percent of the state\u2019s hospital beds and about 6% of its intensive care unit beds are currently available, according to the Department of Health. There are 240 COVID-19 patients in the state\u2019s ICUs. Ninety-eight COVID-19 patients are on ventilators. The state\u2019s COVID-19 deaths rose by 15 to 5,970. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is touring the state holding town halls aimed at encouraging COVID-19 shots, tweeted that 98.3% of those hospitalized in the state since January were unvaccinated.\n\nSacramento: When the state told school districts they must still require masks for students and teachers indoors, it left no room for doubt about enforcement: If students refused, schools were to send them home. But hours after that announcement Monday, public health officials in Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration abruptly changed course and said school districts would decide for themselves how to enforce the mask mandate. The reversal marked a bumpy rollout of the state\u2019s new coronavirus rules for California\u2019s schools, which are required to resume in-person instruction for the upcoming school year. Speaking after an event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Newsom downplayed the reversal, saying enforcement of mask-wearing has \u201calways been a local responsibility.\u201d \u201cAll (the Department of Public Health) did was clarify that local responsibility, which is consistent with all the prior rule-making that has been in effect on mask-wearing going back to last year,\u201d Newsom said. But Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association, said the updated rule \u201cis a huge difference in terms of how districts would operate and how the public is going to receive this guidance.\u201d\n\nDenver: The state has launched a four-year study of American bald eagles to determine how the protected raptors have adapted to population growth along the metropolitan Front Range and identify planning measures that could ensure the bird\u2019s future. Colorado Parks and Wildlife said the study, involving biologists and volunteers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies among others, will monitor nesting sites, food sources such as prairie dog colonies, reproduction, and migration from the Denver area north to the Wyoming border. Between 25 and 30 eagles are being fitted with transmitters using cellular communications networks to provide real-time data on eagle movements. CPW estimated there are more than 90 breeding pairs of bald eagles in the corridor. There were none at the end of the 1970s and only three in all of Colorado. That recovery \u2013 mirroring a nationwide trend \u2013 came after federal and state protections including banning the pesticide DDT. The eagle\u2019s growth has coincided with rapid urban development. Denver\u2019s metropolitan area has nearly 3 million people, and CPW said nearly 750,000 additional people are projected to make the Front Range their home by 2029.\n\nHartford: State lawmakers voted Wednesday to again extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont\u2019s emergency declarations first issued in March 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republicans and some Democrats who argued it\u2019s time to get back to normal. The House of Representatives and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, passed separate resolutions during Wednesday\u2019s special session. \u201cI know that people have COVID fatigue. People want to continue to move back with returning to normalcy, and we are doing that,\u201d said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. \u201cThis resolution will allow that to happen while still allowing us to act in the best interest of public health.\u201d The resolution in the House passed on a 73-56 vote, with nine Democrats joining all the Republicans in opposition. In the Senate, the resolution passed on a 19-15 vote, with four Democrats joining the GOP in voting \u201cno.\u201d The Democratic governor had asked the General Assembly to renew his declarations of public health and civil preparedness emergencies through Sept. 30, noting he is only seeking to extend 11 executive orders. That\u2019s compared to a high of more than 300 at one point during the crisis.\n\nWilmington: DuPont Co. and two spinoffs will pay at least $50million to the state to help clean up toxic chemicals, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. It\u2019s the first time the state\u2019s Department of Justice has resolved environmental damage claims on behalf of the state. The settlement will pay for environmental restoration, improvement, sampling and analysis, community environmental justice and equity grants, and other natural resource needs, the department said. DuPont and Corteva, previously the agriculture division of DowDuPont, will each contribute $12.5 million. Chemours, DuPont\u2019s former performance chemicals unit, will contribute $25 million. The three companies reached a cost-sharing agreement earlier this year. They will fund up to an additional $25 million if they settle similar claims with other states for more than $50 million. The settlement resolves their responsibility for damage caused by releases of historical compounds including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They include perfluorooctanoic acid, which was used in the production of Teflon, and have also been used in firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing and many other household and personal items. They are sometimes referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of their longevity in the environment.\n\nWashington: Nellie\u2019s Sports Bar reopened nearly a month after it closed due to ongoing protests outside after a video showed a security guard dragging a woman out of the establishment by her hair, WUSA-TV reports. But people were outside the establishment Tuesday forming a human chain at the door to dissuade customers from going inside. Nellie\u2019s let go of the security company whose officer was recorded dragging Keisha Young out of the bar June 13, in the wake of the video being released on social media. Protests are planned for Friday evening by a group that is still frustrated about what happened in June, during Pride Month, at the well-known LGBTQ bar. ABRA, the district agency tasked to issue and renew licenses, assigned an investigator to the case. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board held a closed meeting to review the report and referred the case to the District\u2019s Office of Attorney General. Young claimed the issue started when security misidentified her for another woman whom they wanted to leave for allegedly bringing in a bottle from outside. The investigator determined Nellie\u2019s had a difficult time removing patrons through a crowd as they pushed and shoved into other people and got involved in the altercations.\n\nMiami: Norwegian Cruise Line is challenging a new state law that prevents cruise companies from requiring passengers to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Miami federal court, contends that the law jeopardizes safe operation of cruise ships by increasing risk of contracting the coronavirus. Norwegian intends to restart cruises from Florida ports Aug. 15 with vaccinations required for all passengers. Norwegian wants a judge to lift the ban by Aug. 6. The law imposes a fine of $5,000 each time a cruise line mandates that a passenger provide vaccination proof. Norwegian claims it violates federal law and several constitutional rights. The company, officially known as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, says it won\u2019t be able to sail from Florida unless a judge acts to block the law. \u201cThe result would be a devastating, unrecoverable loss for everyone \u2013 not only for NCLH\u2019s business but also for tens of thousands of passengers, employees, and stakeholders who all benefit from NCLH resuming safe operations as planned,\u201d the lawsuit says. The lawsuit names as a defendant Florida\u2019s surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees. He is an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose spokeswoman said the cruise line\u2019s policy discriminates against children under 12 and others who are not vaccinated.\n\nAugusta: In a nightmarish scenario, a couple found 18 snakes under their bed. Instead of killing the creatures, the husband carefully plucked them off the ground, dropped them in a bag and relocated them to a nearby creek. Augusta resident Trish Wilcher told WJBF-TV that as she and her husband, Max, were about to go to bed Sunday, she saw what she thought was some fuzz on the floor. She said it moved when she reached down. \u201cAnd then a second later another piece moved,\u201d Wilcher said. \u201cAnd I went to my husband: \u2018We have snakes!\u2019 \u201d The couple found a mother snake with 17 recently hatched babies under their bed. Max Wilcher used a grabber tool to place each one in a linen bag. The ordeal took until around midnight. \u201cHe brought them out there to the creek area and released them there,\u201d Trish Wilcher said. Outside of finding a place to lay their eggs, there\u2019s another reason snakes may want to share human spaces. Camilla Sherman, an environmental educator for the Phinizy Center for Water Sciences, said snakes sometimes move into homes to hunt rodents. \u201cIf you have a mouse problem, the snakes are going to come and try to help you with that,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nHonolulu: A City Council member has proposed banning unpermitted parking in an Oahu neighborhood while the state closes a popular trail nearby for two years to conduct repairs. The state plans to close Maunawili Falls Trails in Kailua starting Thursday so that it and a private landowner can preserve historic and cultural sites. It also plans to build parking and comfort stations. The trail takes hikers through a lush forest to a waterfall. As the trail has grown in popularity, neighbors have struggled with hikers parking illegally and trespassing, as well as urinating in their yards and leaving behind dirty diapers. Chris Nakamatu of the Maunawili Estates Community Association said about 1,000 people use the trail on the weekends. City Council member Esther Kia\u2019aina, who represents the area, told Hawaii News Now she doesn\u2019t expect people to stop coming when the trail closes, so she\u2019s calling for a ban on unpermitted parking in the neighborhood during the closure. The city already restricts parking for those without permits in a Kalihi neighborhood, she said. \u201cI think that this is the best way to balance the community\u2019s needs with those that are trespassing,\u201d Kia\u2019aina said. Neighbors say they support measures to control the crowds and revive the trail.\n\nBoise: Residents and visitors need to help prevent wildfires in what could be a challenging season with continued high temperatures and most of the state in drought, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said Tuesday that there\u2019s a potential for multiple giant wildfires in Idaho that use up firefighting resources and leave some areas unprotected. He spoke at an outdoor news conference hazy with smoke from wildfires from nearby states. \u201cMy fear is that we will have some of these great big mega-fires that start creating their own weather, like the one that is over in Oregon, where I think a lot of this smoke is coming from, that basically endanger communities; they endanger firefighters; they endanger precious wildlife and watershed capacity,\u201d he said. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years, and scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Special calculations are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event. Little has already tapped the Idaho National Guard in what could be the worst wildfire season in the state in years. That includes the use of helicopters that can fight fires, transport firefighters or deliver supplies.\n\nChicago: Five people were rushed to area hospitals after being shot Wednesday afternoon on Chicago\u2019s South Side, about 12 hours after another shooting elsewhere in the city wounded five other people, police said. Tom Ahern, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, said he did not know the conditions of the victims who were shot just after noon. He also did not yet know the ages of the victims, but he said he did not believe that any of them were children. No arrests have been made, he said. Just after midnight Wednesday, five other people \u2013 four women and a man \u2013 were shot as they stood outside in the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. \u201cA group was standing outside when they were approached by an unidentified male \u2026 who produced a handgun and began shooting. The victims attempted to flee the scene once the shooting began,\u201d police said in a statement. Four of the victims, who range in age from 18 to 29, were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. A fifth victim, a 34-year-old woman, was shot in the leg but refused to be taken to a hospital, police said. And about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood, a 2-year-old boy and 32-year-old man were critically wounded when someone pulled up in front of a home near which they were standing and opened fire.\n\nIndianapolis: The leaders of two now-closed online charter schools are accused in a new lawsuit of defrauding the state of more than $150 million by padding their student enrollments and inappropriately paying money to a web of related businesses. The lawsuit announced Monday by the state attorney general\u2019s office comes nearly two years after Indiana Virtual School and Indiana Virtual Pathways Academy shut down amid a state investigation that found the two online schools improperly claimed about 14,000 students as enrolled between 2011 and 2019, even though they had no online course activity. The lawsuit seeks repayment of about $69 million it claims the schools wrongly received in state student enrollment payments. It also seeks $86 million that officials say the schools improperly paid to more than a dozen companies linked to them by common business officers or relatives and did so with little or no documentation. \u201cThis massive attempt to defraud Hoosier taxpayers through complex schemes truly boggles the mind,\u201d Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, said in a statement. A state audit linked much of the misspending to Thomas Stoughton, who headed the online schools from 2011 to 2017 and owned or had business associates who operated about a dozen companies that received school payments.\n\nAltoona: Workers used a crane Tuesday to remove a boat from an amusement park ride as part of the investigation into an accident that killed one boy and critically injured his brother. The boat, which weighs over 1,700 pounds, was removed from the human-made channel on the Raging River ride so that inspectors and engineers could have a closer examination, Adventureland Park attorney Guy Cook said. The boat was placed on a trailer and taken to a secure location, as the investigation into the \u201ctragic and extremely unusual accident continues,\u201d he said. The boat was carrying six members of a Marion, Iowa, family at the park in Altoona when it unexpectedly overturned on the evening of July 3, trapping two brothers under the water for minutes. Michael Jaramillo, 11, died of his injuries the next day, while 16-year-old David Jaramillo remains hospitalized in critical condition. David Jaramillo is still heavily sedated and hooked up to oxygen, unable to talk or see for the moment, said family attorney Ryan Best. His father, also David Jaramillo, was undergoing surgery Tuesday on bones he broke in his shoulder when the boat overturned, before he was able to free himself, Best said. Michael Jaramillo\u2019s funeral is scheduled for Saturday at a Des Moines church.\n\nTopeka: A Republican lawmaker questioned Tuesday whether Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s administration made unemployment fraud worse by not conducting adequate background checks on hundreds of people hired to help with a surge of claims during the pandemic. Sen. Caryn Tyson, of Parker, raised the issue as the state prepared to launch a new investigation of unemployment fraud. Tyson serves on a new council created by the GOP-controlled Legislature to oversee a modernization of the Kansas Department of Labor\u2019s aged computer system and to audit fraud and its effects. The state Department of Labor has estimated fraudulent claims last year totaled $290 million, but a report by the Legislature\u2019s auditing arm estimated $600 million. The council on Tuesday discussed the scope of its audit so the state can take bids from private firms for the work, with a preliminary report due May 1, 2022. The final report is expected by September next year. The council expects to set the audit\u2019s scope next week, but Tyson said auditors should examine possible \u201choles or flaws in the human side\u201d of computer security, particularly given the big expansion of the department\u2019s workforce.\n\nLouisville: Bourbon tourism is getting another boost from a distillery in the city. Angel\u2019s Envy says it will be able to accommodate twice as many guests once an $8.2 million expansion is completed next spring at its downtown Louisville site. The craft distiller says the project includes a new event space and bar, a larger retail space, and several new tasting rooms. The distillery will remain open to the public throughout the construction. \u201cAngel\u2019s Envy is a prime example of how Kentucky\u2019s signature bourbon industry immensely benefits our commonwealth by attracting visitors to the state while creating quality opportunities for Kentuckians,\u201d Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Kentucky is home to 66 spirits operations employing more than 5,100 people full time statewide, Beshear\u2019s office said. In 2020, the industry announced 20 projects in Kentucky, totaling more than $300 million in new investment. Kentucky crafts 95% of the world\u2019s bourbon supply, according to the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association.\n\nNew Orleans: Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 at large events \u2013 including mask mandates or requirements that attendees be vaccinated or have a negative coronavirus test \u2013 will likely continue into the fall because of low state vaccination rates and the spread of dangerous virus variants, the city\u2019s health director said Tuesday. Dr. Jennifer Avegno\u2019s remarks came at a news conference focusing on the city\u2019s efforts to encourage vaccinations in a state that has one of the nation\u2019s lowest inoculation rates. Louisiana health officials on Tuesday said COVID-19 cases are surging, largely among unvaccinated people, as the more easily transmissible delta variant spreads in the state. Avegno\u2019s remarks come as the city looks to a new NFL and college football season and the return of major entertainment events such as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, which was postponed from its usual spring dates. The city currently allows major events to have full capacity if there is a mask requirement or if attendees are required to have either a vaccination or a negative virus test. \u201cI think folks should expect that that might the case in the fall,\u201d Avegno said. \u201cWe would all love to have large events that did not require some degree of mitigation. And before delta I was maybe a little more confident that we would get there.\u201d\n\nAugusta: A bill that aimed to eliminate the state\u2019s privately owned electric utilities by buying them out and replacing them with a consumer-owned utility was vetoed Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, likely spelling the end of the proposal this legislative session. Mills acknowledged that the performance of Central Maine Power and Versant Power has been \u201cabysmal\u201d but said the proposal to send them packing \u2013 with voters getting the final say \u2013 was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201chastily drafted and hastily amended.\u201d \u201cI certainly agree that change is necessary. No question about that. And I remain open to considering alternative proposals,\u201d she said. The bill\u2019s chief sponsor, Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, disputed the governor\u2019s characterization of the proposal, arguing that it was thoroughly vetted over the past three years. And it isn\u2019t going away. A coalition will be launching a referendum drive to put the proposal before voters anyway next year, instead of this fall. Supporters said it\u2019s time to replace Central Maine Power and Versant Power, which are owned by corporations in Spain and Canada, with an entity that works in the interest of Mainers instead of shareholders. The new entity, Pine Tree Power, would keep rates low, respond faster to outages and support clean energy projects, they said.\n\nAnnapolis: Grow & Fortify is looking to make it easier for craft alcohol fans in the state to track their endeavors. The Maryland-based agricultural cooperative launched the Maryland Craft Beverages app Wednesday. It allows users to plan future stops, track locations they have visited and participate in industry-tailored passports, according to a press release. The app will include trails dedicated to beer, wine, spirits, cider and mead. A directory in the app will feature active members of the Brewers Association of Maryland, the Maryland Distillers Guild and the Maryland Wineries Association. Through the app, Grow & Fortify hopes to connect users with local tasting rooms and boost revenue for beverage producers in Maryland, according to the release. The app will replace the annually printed Maryland Craft Beverage map that Grow & Fortify previously distributed at tourist destinations around the state. Daruma Tech developed the app, which will be available for free in the Apple and Google Play stores.\n\nBoston: The rise of hybrid and remote work during the past year and a half is just one of the ways the future of business in Massachusetts could change in the post-pandemic years, shifting the state\u2019s economic \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d away from the greater Boston core, according to a report released Tuesday by the Baker administration. Even as COVID-19 concerns ease, public transit ridership likely won\u2019t return to pre-pandemic levels, with the steepest decline likely in commuter rail, according to the report, which found business travel may also fall compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. The report anticipates that changes in the economic landscape will require sweeping workforce training programs to connect workers with key skills for the future economy, with as many as 400,000 people needing to transition to different occupations or occupational categories over the next decade. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the state needs to \u201cturbo-charge\u201d those training programs. The governor also said the state needs to increase the production of new housing and support downtown economies, as well as adapt to new transportation demands and promote flexibility in child care options, including increased child care subsidies for lower-income families.\n\nFlint: A federal judge listened Tuesday to residents who were victims of the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water, a step in determining whether she should sign off on a $641 million deal that would settle claims against the state. More than a dozen people without lawyers signed up to speak, all in opposition. Thousands more are represented by attorneys who negotiated the settlement with Michigan and other parties and urged approval a day earlier. \u201cThis is a little unusual,\u201d said U.S. District Judge Judith Levy, who left her courthouse in Ann Arbor for a courtroom 55 miles away in Genesee County. The settlement fund includes $600 million from Michigan and $20 million from Flint. But attorneys are seeking $200 million in fees. \u201cThe lawyers are making out like fat rats,\u201d Audrey Young-Muhammed complained to the judge. Money would be available to every Flint child who was exposed to the water, adults who can show an injury, landlords, business owners, and anyone who paid water bills. More than 50,000 people have filed claims in a city with a population of roughly 95,000. Kids are supposed to get 80% of the money. Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement that the deal provides relief and prevents a \u201cdrawn out legal back-and-forth.\u201d But the Rev. Freelon Threlkeld, addressing the judge, described the settlement as \u201csome crumbs.\u201d\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources says it won\u2019t consider holding a wolf hunting or trapping season until 2022 at the earliest. The agency said in a statement last week that it\u2019s taking longer than expected to update its 20-year-old wolf management plan, and it\u2019s now expected to be done by March. \u201cWe will use our updated plan as we determine whether and how to use various management tools to ensure continuation of a healthy and sustainable wolf population in Minnesota,\u201d the statement said. \u201cConsideration of whether to hold hunting or trapping seasons will be guided by the updated plan.\u201d Then-President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in November ended Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in most of the United States, leaving states and tribes in charge of overseeing the animals. Minnesota held wolf seasons from 2012 to 2014 until courts blocked them. Some states moved quickly to liberalize hunting and trapping rules. The Center for Biological Diversity praised Minnesota for moving deliberately. Collette Adkins, the Arizona-based group\u2019s carnivore conservation director, said Minnesota had \u201cwisely prioritized first updating the management plan to reflect new science and the values of all Minnesotans.\u201d\n\nJackson: Some residents with overdue water bills could be eligible for support through a new program the city announced this week. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba on Monday said the city wants to help residents catch up on past-due bills and offer potential debt forgiveness. It will apply to low-income residents, those with water issues related to faulty equipment and individuals affected by weather events. Lumumba said money recouped through the program could be used to fix widespread infrastructure issues with the water system. City water customers owe more than $100 million in unpaid bills. \u201cThe city\u2019s water woes have been well-chronicled,\u201d Lumumba said at a briefing outside City Hall. \u201cI\u2019m asking all residents become a part of the program. If you qualify under the low-income program, you can look forward to turning the page.\u201d The payment plans providing customers with additional time to make payments on their water bills will go into effect July 19. For those with large debt, the plan will allow residents to pay a monthly amount with an additional $10 tacked on over several months to cover past-due bills. Provided the resident pays on a timely basis, some debt can be forgiven, Lumumba said.\n\nJefferson City: College and university officials in the state will be able to raise tuition as much as they want under legislation Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed Tuesday. Currently, public colleges and universities can only raise tuition a limited amount to keep up with inflation, compensate for cuts in state aid, or keep up with the average tuition rates across the state. The new law will allow college officials to raise tuition as much as they want beginning in July 2022. Schools will be allowed to charge different tuition rates for different degrees, a change aimed at letting colleges set higher tuition in fields with higher education costs. The wide-ranging legislation also will let college athletes profit off their fame and celebrity, although the NCAA preemptively scrapped its rules against that earlier this month. Missouri joins a growing list of states that have enacted laws allowing student-athletes to earn money for autographs, sponsorships, or other uses of their names, images, likenesses or athletic reputations.\n\nGreat Falls: Two Native American women are leading cultural hikes throughout the state, sharing Indigenous stories connected to the land and animals who live there. As Lailani Upham and Carrie Bear Chief hiked through Upper Two Medicine in Glacier National Park on July 8, Lailani and Carrie told the story of a young warrior. The man was injured, and his two comrades left him in the park, but the man was later helped by a bear, who communicated with him in the Blackfoot language. They also told the story of a non-Native man who lived among the Blackfeet people. A sharpshooter, this man shot a bighorn sheep in the very spot they stood in the park. Lailani and Carrie collect stories from elders, and they record oral histories and study books that chronicle Indigenous people in Montana. Lailani, a Blackfeet woman who loves the outdoors, in March launched Iron Shield Creative, a platform that aims to \u201cbring Indigenous stories to the world.\u201d The business also offers multimedia storytelling projects and workshops. \u201cI wanted to see people within our tribal communities get to document their own stories,\u201d she said. Lailani said storytelling is crucial because it \u201cbrings people together.\u201d Carrie, who works as a storyteller guide for Iron Shield Creative, said storytelling keeps Indigenous culture and tradition alive.\n\nLincoln: Former state Rep. Ernie Chambers, known for seeking the censure of judges he believes have acted outside the bounds of fairness, is targeting a judge in the state\u2019s northeastern corner who saw the Nebraska Supreme Court overturn his denial of an adoption petition to a same-sex couple. In a complaint filed last week with the Nebraska Judicial Qualifications Commission, Chambers accused Dixon County Judge Douglas Luebe of violating state law requiring judges perform their duties fairly and impartially and without bias, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Luebe described himself as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d in denying an adoption petition for a same-sex married couple last year. His denial was based not on state law but on a legal definition of \u201cwife\u201d that he pulled from a law dictionary. Luebe said the married women who sought to adopt had listed themselves in their petition as \u201cwife and wife.\u201d He balked, saying the dictionary defined \u201cwife\u201d as \u201c \u2018a woman who has a lawful living husband.\u2019 \u201d Nebraska\u2019s highest court overturned that denial in March, ruling that the plain language of state adoption law does not preclude same-sex married couples from adopting. In his complaint, Chambers called Luebe a \u201cscalawag in judicial robes.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas: A Republican pageant winner and business owner is running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. Sharelle Mendenhall filed as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month and is scheduled to officially kick off her campaign Thursday evening with a rally in Las Vegas. Mendenhall was Mrs. Nevada United States in 2020 and Ms. California United States in 2019. She is also the owner of Elite Expo Talent Agency, which hires models and talent for conventions and other events. Her campaign describes her as \u201ca strong Christian, lifelong conservative\u201d and supporter of former President Donald Trump. She joins Reno businessman and Army veteran Sam Brown in the GOP primary. Brown is expected to hold a rally kicking off his campaign July 24. Republican Adam Laxalt, the former Nevada attorney general, has said he\u2019s considering another run for public office and is expected to join the race as well. Cortez Masto, who is seeking reelection, is the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. She was elected in 2016, winning the seat held by longtime Sen. Harry Reid after he retired.\n\nChesterfield: Since the 1960s, visitors along a forest trail could see stone stairs and archways, remnants of a country house that was referred to as a \u201ccastle.\u201d That\u2019s now giving way to gravity. The top section of stairs collapsed over the weekend in Madame Sherri Forest in West Chesterfield, named after a Ziegfeld Follies costume designer who lived in the house and threw parties for New York\u2019s theatrical elite in the 1930s, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. The house was lost in a fire in 1962. The land is owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Jack Savage, society president, said with all the rain the area has seen recently, it wouldn\u2019t surprise him to hear the ground under the steps was saturated, and something just gave way. The society recently hosted a work party at the castle, cleaning up graffiti and weeding. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very popular place,\u201d Savage said. \u201cPeople will likely want to go see what\u2019s there no more, but we ask that they stay away from the rubble so they don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d Madame Sherri, who was born Antoinette Bramare in 1878 in Paris, built her castle in 1929. She eventually abandoned the home and died in 1965 in Brattleboro, Vermont, at age 87.\n\nTrenton: Nearly 88,000 low-level marijuana offenses have been dismissed over the past two weeks, the state Supreme Court said, as the Garden State transitions to legalizing and decriminalizing the drug. The dismissed cases announced late Monday afternoon are the first in a wave of about 360,000 that are eligible to be automatically vacated, dismissed and expunged under the decriminalization law Gov. Phil Murphy signed earlier this year. Although the first batch of cases have been dismissed, they still have to go through the expungement process, which is automatic under the law. Earlier this month, New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner directed that pending cases and warrants for fourth-degree and disorderly persons offenses related to marijuana or hashish \u2013 including possession and distribution of small amounts, being under the influence and operating a motor vehicle while in possession of the drugs \u2013 be dismissed. The court\u2019s July 1 order also said that related violations of probation or pretrial monitoring will be vacated and that driver\u2019s license suspensions or revocations for failure to appear will be rescinded. Cases of eligible defendants who are pending sentencing or have completed sentencing will also be vacated and dismissed, the court said.\n\nAlbuquerque: Some of the state\u2019s top climate and water experts warned lawmakers Tuesday that the effects of the drought on water supplies have been worsened by climate change, specifically an ongoing, long-term warming trend. They told members of a legislative committee that the drought is a harbinger of still more arid conditions to come as temperatures continue to climb and as rainfall becomes more variable. Human-caused climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Increasing temperatures also can lead to the snowpack that feeds rivers and streams melting several weeks earlier and more rapidly, resulting in more evaporation. That means less runoff into the Rio Grande, Pecos and other rivers, and that\u2019s not going to change, since the experts said there are no indications that the long-term temperature trend will go away. New Mexico uses all its water and is pretty well tapped out when it comes to new supplies, said retired professor David Gutzler. He said long-term climate change should lead policymakers to expect and plan for diminished surface water supplies in the decades going forward. Groundwater supplies also are being depleted as more people are forced to pump water to make up for dwindling flows.\n\nAlbany: It will be weeks before the state issues any payments from its $2.4 billion COVID-19 rent relief fund, state officials said Tuesday, adding to delays in a program that has been beset by technical glitches with its online application portal. At least 1.1 million New York households that rent have at least one family member who was economically affected by the pandemic, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration. But New York is one of four states that did not distribute any of the tens of billions of dollars in rent relief that Congress has paid out to states this year, according to a U.S. Treasury report of spending through May. On June 1, New York launched an online application portal allowing tenants and landlords to apply for rent \u2013 nearly two months after lawmakers first created the $2.4 billion fund. The State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance has said it would take four to six weeks to process applications to release payments to landlords. Six weeks later, agency spokesperson Anthony Farmer said Tuesday that first payments are \u201cexpected to go out in the coming weeks.\u201d Tenants and landlords alike say New York\u2019s application portal is too difficult, time-consuming and glitch-prone to ensure eligible New Yorkers are getting the help they need applying.\n\nRaleigh: Republicans advanced legislation Wednesday that defines how teachers can discuss certain concepts about race and racism inside the classroom. GOP Senate leader Phil Berger said his chamber is taking action as conservatives across the country seek to counter their understanding of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d a framework legal scholars developed in the 1970s and 1980s that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation\u2019s institutions, maintaining the dominance of white people in society. The latest version of the North Carolina bill would prevent teachers from compelling students to personally adopt any ideas from a list of 13 beliefs, even though though they cannot identify a single case of this happening inside the state\u2019s classrooms, which serve about 1.5 million K-12 public school students. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to indoctrinate folks in what I think is the core of critical race theory, which is that race is determinative of whether or not someone is going to be successful, that race is determinative of all matter of things that happen in society and that past discrimination justifies current discrimination,\u201d Berger said in an interview before unveiling the updated education measure.\n\nFargo: City commissioners have directed the police department to present them with hate crime findings. \u201cI\u2019m going to be reporting on the hate crimes in terms of whether or not the city ordinance was issued or reports where the city ordinance was applied or federal law was applied,\u201d said Dave Zibolski, chief of the Fargo Police Department. \u201cOur current hate crimes are reviewed if they meet the elements of the federal law by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Zibolski said the reports will help determine whether the city\u2019s ordinance on hate crimes is effective. \u201cWith the new hate crimes ordinance, we\u2019ll have some additional and potential ordinance violations. So we\u2019ll track those as well in terms of how many of those come in, and we\u2019ll add in the prosecution piece. So what was prosecuted so they have reported in terms of is the ordinance is effective in a sense or how often is it used,\u201d Zibolski told KVRR-TV. Eleven cases were investigated as potential hate crimes this year, \u201cbut through the course of the investigation, none of those could be shown to be hate crime-related in terms of the ability to prosecute them,\u201d he said. Zibolski said reports of hate crimes are posted on the department\u2019s website monthly.\n\nColumbus: Vaccination trends have led to the development of \u201ctwo Ohios\u201d when it comes to combating COVID-19, increasing vulnerability to the coronavirus\u2019 highly contagious delta variant, the state\u2019s top medical official warned Wednesday. The delta variant is rapidly becoming the disease\u2019s dominant strain and is a real threat to those who are unvaccinated, said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, chief medical officer for the Ohio Department of Health. The delta variant was first identified in India and is now spreading in more than 90 other countries. Meanwhile, about 5.3 million people in Ohio, or 45% of the population, have completed the inoculation process. \u201cThe reality is, we now have two Ohios,\u201d Vanderhoff said. \u201cAn Ohio that is vaccinated and protected on the one hand, and an Ohio that is unvaccinated and vulnerable to delta on the other.\u201d About 9 of every 10 people hospitalized for COVID-19 in central Ohio since April have been vaccinated only partially or not at all, said Dr. Andrew Thomas, chief clinical officer at the Ohio State University medical center. The doctors\u2019 remarks came a day after Gov. Mike DeWine said Ohio will soon announce a second vaccine incentive program following the Vax-a-Million initiative that offered five $1 million prizes and five full-ride college scholarships.\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt was forced to end a forum early after he and a panel of district attorneys were berated as they sought to explain the position prosecutors are taking on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s McGirt decision. Stitt ended the \u201cMcGirt v Oklahoma Community Forum\u201d roughly an hour earlier than planned Tuesday amid jeering from the audience as he tried to explain how the high court\u2019s decision had unintended consequences for victims of crime regardless of tribal citizenship. The McGirt decision determined that a large swath of eastern Oklahoma remains an American Indian reservation and that state prosecutors lack the authority to pursue criminal charges in cases in which the defendants or victims are tribal citizens. It has led to dozens of criminal convictions in Oklahoma being overturned, including some death row cases. Most of those cases are having to be retried in federal court. \u201cNobody on this panel created the McGirt situation,\u201d Stitt said shortly before ending the program. \u201cThis is a complicated issue, and we have 400,000 Natives who live in the state of Oklahoma. We\u2019ve got 3.6 million non-Natives living in the state of Oklahoma. We need to keep all Oklahomans safe.\u201d But the main source of frustration for Native Americans who attended the forum was the lack of tribal representation on the panel, the Tulsa World reports.\n\nPortland: Residents struggled to get rides to cooling centers during the recent heat wave that is believed to have killed hundreds across the Pacific Northwest, officials said Monday, and staffing shortages prevented callers from reaching operators at an information line. State authorities are examining their response to scorching temperatures that broke all-time records across the region late last month as the West struggles with a historic drought and as climate change makes extreme weather more common and intense. Oregon blamed 116 deaths on the heat. \u201cOne of the heartbreaking things about this heat wave is that there were resources that were available to communities, whether it was cooling centers or transportation, and folks couldn\u2019t access those resources to protect themselves,\u201d Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, said at a news conference. In the week leading up to the late June heat wave, Oregon officials contacted providers, set up cooling centers and connected with vulnerable populations, including the thousands of homeless people who live on the streets of Portland and in low-income communities. One major complaint from community members was not knowing where to go to cool down and a struggle to find that information.\n\nCarlisle: The disinterred remains of nine Native American children who died more than a century ago while attending a government-run school in Pennsylvania were headed home to Rosebud Sioux tribal lands in South Dakota on Wednesday after a ceremony returning them to relatives. The handoff at a graveyard on the grounds of the U.S. Army\u2019s Carlisle Barracks was part of the fourth set of transfers to take place since 2017. The remains of an Alaskan Aleut child were returned to her tribe earlier this summer. \u201cWe want our children home no matter how long it takes,\u201d said U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who in June announced a nationwide investigation into the boarding schools that attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into white society. Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, said at the event that \u201cforced assimilation practices\u201d stripped away the children\u2019s clothing, their language and their culture. She said the government aims to locate the schools and burial sites and identify the names and tribal affiliations of children from the boarding schools around the country. In Pennsylvania, the nine sets of remains inside small wooden coffins were carried past a phalanx of tribal members and well-wishers before being loaded into a trailer to be driven to Sioux City, Iowa. The children died between 1880 and 1910.\n\nProvidence: State environmental regulators have denied a permit for a medical waste-to-energy facility in West Warwick. In denying the application Tuesday for MedRecycler-RI Inc., the Department of Environmental Management cited several factors, including a recently passed law prohibiting new high-heat medical waste processing facilities in the state. The agency also cited environmental concerns; a lack of adequate details about testing protocols; the facility\u2019s lack of emergency response plans; a lack of clarity about how much and where medical waste would be stored; the facility\u2019s proximity to residential neighborhoods; and questions about the facility\u2019s technology, which has not previously been used on medical waste. The company planned to use a process known as pyrolysis to break down used gloves, tubing and syringes to generate power. MedRecycler has said the facility will be safe, provide jobs and tax revenue. The site would not accept hazardous waste. The company said it was not subject to the new law because it does not apply retroactively. Nicholas Campanella, chairman and CEO of MedRecycler\u2019s parent company, Sun Pacific Holding Corp., told The Boston Globe that the company is considering its legal options.\n\nMount Pleasant: An abandoned liposuction machine was the suspicious package that closed one of the state\u2019s busiest bridges for three hours over the weekend, according to authorities. Someone called police Saturday after finding a metal box near a pillar of the Ravenel Bridge in Mount Pleasant, just across the Cooper River from Charleston, investigators said. The caller showed officers pictures of a metal box with a lock, green and red buttons, and a fan. Officers then confirmed the box\u2019s location, and a supervisor shut down the bridge and called the bomb squad, according to a Mount Pleasant Police report. The bridge was opened after about three hours, and officials confirmed Monday that the item was a liposuction machine. The Ravenel Bridge carries about 77,000 vehicles a day on U.S. Highway 17 between Charleston and Mount Pleasant, according to South Carolina Department of Transportation data.\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem suspended her Cabinet secretary overseeing state prisons and the warden of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls, following an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees, that employee morale is low and that promotions are plagued by nepotism. The governor said she was briefed about 7 p.m. Tuesday on an internal review from the Bureau of Human Resources that was prompted by the anonymous complaint. Less than three hours later, Noem said she was putting Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt and State Penitentiary Warden Darin Young on administrative leave and commissioning an investigation into the allegations. The complaints had been known to state officials for months, according to the organization that represents state employees. The two pages of the complaint released by Noem\u2019s office do not name either Leidholt or Young but allege that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could \u201cwork in the same vicinities as their interest/victims.\u201d\n\nNashville: The federal government will not alert the state when unaccompanied migrant children are brought to Tennessee to be placed with sponsors, officials with Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s administration told lawmakers Tuesday. Brandon Gibson, Lee\u2019s chief operating officer, said that the federal Department of Health and Human Services has largely directed her questions to information posted on government websites and policy statutes. Gibson said it\u2019s her interpretation that the federal government could disclose information to local law enforcement about when immigrant children pass through the state, but federal officials have told her they won\u2019t due to privacy concerns. \u201cThe response I got from HHS was that because of confidentiality they would not be notifying local law enforcement,\u201d Gibson said. HHS officials did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Gibson gave her remarks Tuesday before a legislative panel made up of entirely of GOP members. The group is tasked with investigating refugee and immigration settlement in Tennessee after a local television station aired footage of children arriving at a Chattanooga airport and boarding buses in the middle of the night.\n\nAustin: State officials on Tuesday added 59 deaths to the toll wrought by the Feb. 14 cold wave and the ensuing collapse of the state\u2019s electric power grid. The deaths newly tallied by the Texas Department of State Health Services boosted the toll from 151 to 210 deaths, most from exposure to the sometimes-subzero temperatures. Still, some were blamed on carbon monoxide poisoning as freezing Texans sought warmth from cars and outdoor grills. The count remained preliminary and may change as more deaths are confirmed, the department said. The county with the highest death toll was Harris, where Houston is located, with 43 deaths. Travis County, where Austin holds most of its population, had 28 deaths. Dallas County reported 20 deaths. The toll is a far cry from the initial March 15 report of 57 deaths. The toll was raised to 111 on March 25, 125 on April 6 and 151 on April 28. The collapse of the power grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has made electric reliability in Texas an ongoing political question. In early June, Gov. Gregg Abbott declared that state lawmakers had fixed the problem. Since then, two conservation alerts issued by ERCOT during temperate spring weather prompted renewed questions.\n\nDraper: The drought gripping the West is contributing to an increased number of mountain lion sightings in the state, police said. It appears cougars are being forced into more populated areas to get enough water to drink, Draper Police Lt. Pat Evans told Fox13 News. One recent encounter happened in Coyote Hollow, near the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper. Hiker Sherie Allen said she had just hit the trail with friend Shelli Roberts and Roberts\u2019 small Shitsu Yorkie dog, Buster, when she heard something. \u201cWe hear this like, \u2018rawrrrr\u2019 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like a growl, it was like that screech,\u201d she said. It was a cougar, about 6 feet away. \u201cShe, luckily, grabbed my arm and was like, \u2018Whatever you do, do not run,\u2019 and she stopped me in my tracks,\u201d Roberts said of Allen. Roberts picked up Buster, and the big cat tracked them as they backed away slowly and got away safely. Other hikers should be aware of the danger and watch for big cats. In an encounter, people should try to make themselves look big, maintain eye contact and never run away from a cougar. Any small pets or kids should be kept close.\n\nBurlington: Some performance venues across the state are preparing to reopen with help from federal money after the coronavirus pandemic forced them to close. So far, 43 Vermont locales benefited from the $13 million from the Shuttered Venue Operator Grant program, part of federal pandemic relief assistance. \u201cFrom Brattleboro to St. Albans, from Derby Line down to Bennington, there\u2019s gonna be a real shot that your community theater, your community venue will be reopened very soon,\u201d Vermont\u2019s Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch told MyNBC5. Two Burlington locations are preparing to reopen. The Vermont Comedy Club, which received more than $400,000, is set to reopen Labor Day weekend. The Flynn Center, which received more than $1.8 million, plans to open again in October. \u201cThe funding came through right at the perfect time for us to be able to hire our contractors and start booking talent,\u201d said Natalie Miller, co-owner of Vermont Comedy Club. Miller said the club is getting ready for the reopening. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be able to space people out a little bit more because everyone is in there, they\u2019re laughing, droplet city. So we\u2019re gonna make it a lot safer,\u201d she said.\n\nNorfolk: An effort is underway to make the larger Chesapeake Bay area part of the National Park Service. The Virginian-Pilot reports it would be called the Chesapeake National Recreation Area. Behind the effort is a group of conservation nonprofits, community leaders and lawmakers who are working to draft legislation in Congress. It\u2019s unclear exactly what the recreation area would look like. Proponents don\u2019t call for the entire bay to be included. But certain land-based sites would provide public access to it. \u201cThe Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, and the national park system represents America\u2019s most treasured landscapes,\u201d said Reed Perry, external affairs manager for the Chesapeake Conservancy, which is a part of the group. The idea has been around since the 1960s. And the park service has already established itself along parts of the nation\u2019s largest estuary. For instance, there is the 3,000-mile Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail and the Fort Monroe National Monument in Hampton. A federal working group has been formed to explore the possibility of designating the Chesapeake recreation area.\n\nYakima: An extreme heat wave damaged cherries grown in the Yakima Valley and the Northwest in late June and early July. The high temperature reached 113 degrees Fahrenheit in Yakima on June 29, an all-time record. The heat caused various issues, such as sunburn and stunted growth that made the cherries unsuitable for the fresh cherry market, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Many cherries were left on trees, while others were picked but processed, which provides a lower return to growers. Northwest Cherry Growers is still assessing the damage, but President B.J. Thurlby estimated about 20% of the overall crop was lost. Much of the loss happened in the Yakima Valley, where cherries were about to be picked. The Northwest cherry growing region includes five states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. In May, the Yakima-based organization estimated a crop of 23.8 million 20-pound boxes in the five-state growing region. Thurlby said the yield this season is now likely in the 18 million to 19 million box range, which would be similar to the 2020 crop. Last year\u2019s crop was affected by frost and wind before harvest. A few cherry varieties received a disproportionate amount of damage: Bing and Skeena, two red-fleshed cherry varieties, and the popular Rainier.\n\nCharleston: The governor has launched a program to showcase chefs across the state. The West Virginia Chef Ambassador Program aims to promote culinary innovation and farm-to-table experiences with the goal of expanding the state\u2019s agritourism industry, officials said. Gov. Jim Justice launched the program Monday in partnership with the West Virginia Department of Tourism. Nominations are open for this year\u2019s inaugural class of chef ambassadors. \u201cWest Virginia\u2019s culinary industry is one of our state\u2019s best-kept secrets,\u201d Justice said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we take the flavors we all know and love \u2013 and the chefs behind our favorite local dishes \u2013 and shine a spotlight on the great things happening across the Mountain State.\u201d The initiative will serve as a partnership between the Tourism Department and the top nine chefs to promote dining and Appalachian cuisine. Ambassadors will be selected to serve one-year terms. Each ambassador will be selected to represent a specific travel region.\n\nMadison: The operators of a startup that allows private homeowners to rent their swimming pools by the hour said Wednesday that Wisconsin regulators are all wet and want them to back off demands that they say would kill their business. Wisconsin is the first state to push back against Swimply, which started in 2018 with just four pools in New Jersey but has taken off during the pandemic as more people looked for private spaces to swim and have fun. The business works like an Airbnb for swimming pools. Private homeowners list their pools on the website and app as available for rent. Most of the pools on Swimply are in warm-weather locations, but it recently dove into the Wisconsin market. It currently has only about a dozen pools available to rent statewide, starting at about $35 an hour, but it\u2019s looking to expand. Wisconsin regulators told Swimply in April that pools offered for rent would have to be treated the same as large, public swimming pools. That means a pool\u2019s owner would have to obtain a license and meet construction requirements that are more onerous. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, which is representing Swimply, said it will file a lawsuit if the state doesn\u2019t back off. Wisconsin is the only state that has challenged Swimply, institute spokeswoman Erin Collins said.\n\nLaramie: The president of the University of Wyoming is proposing several academic changes and up to 75 layoffs as the university absorbs budget cuts due to a decline in state support over the past several years. President Ed Seidel will present the plan to the university\u2019s Board of Trustees this week, and the panel is expected to take public comment before voting on it in November, the university said. The proposal would eliminate some programs with low enrollment and consolidate and reconfigure some of its colleges to better combine degree programs that have overlapping courses while reducing redundancies, officials said. The changes will lead to the layoff of at least 10 department heads. However, the university will look to rehire some of them for new departments that are created, university spokesperson Chad Baldwin said Tuesday. Seidel\u2019s administration is proposing adding a School of Computing, a Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation, Tourism and Hospitality Initiative. Those programs are aimed at training students for future jobs in the state. The university has absorbed $42 million in cuts.",

            "description": "Seven Seven Six, Alexis Ohanian's New VC Firm, Launches With $150 Million And A Promise To Shake Things Up  Forbes",
            "content": "Plenty of venture capital shops have built software to support their startup investing before\u2014some quietly, some for marketing effect. But to hear Alexis Ohanian describe his new VC firm Seven Seven Six\u2019s tools\u2014dramatically named \u201cCerebro,\u201d after the X-Men character\u2014he\u2019s reinvented the wheel. And the former Reddit cofounder\u2019s confident enough in his pitch that it\u2019s hard not to go along with it.\n\nAppearing to be a mash-up of Reddit and other tools like Notion and Roam Research, Cerebro\u2019s part note-taking app (think startup pitch notes and growth updates), talent directory (Ohanian\u2019s vast professional network is in there, searchable by keyword like \u201cmachine learning\u201d or name, with those folks he personally vouches for given an \u201cupvote\u201d) and message board (at the end of this month, investors in Seven Seven Six will get access to notes such as what backers of the fund Ohanian\u2019s met at Roland Garros, where his wife, Serena Williams, recently competed in the French Open, had to say about Europe\u2019s family offices\u2019 investment appetite). And it\u2019s one of a few flourishes that Ohanian and his collaborators on Seven Seven Six see as difference makers in what they say is a new type of VC firm.\n\n\u201cI know people want to talk to me about marketing or community or other things, but building product is what I love,\u201d Ohanian says. \u201cI\u2019m motivated a lot by what I see as a changing tide in venture, and I think it\u2019s become clear that venture is not immune from the software eating up every industry.\u201d\n\nOhanian\u2019s bid to be part of VC\u2019s new wave: Seven Seven Six, which \u201claunched\u201d on Thursday by announcing it had formally closed its first fund, a $150 million vehicle, on target with what it was widely reported as targeting last fall. Founded alongside two of Ohanian\u2019s longtime collaborators from Reddit and his previous venture firm in founding partner Katelin Holloway and founding chief of staff Lissie Garvin, Seven Seven Six will look to lead or colead seed investments; it\u2019s made 17 so far.\n\nSeven Seven Six is backed by a mix of endowments, foundations, funds of funds and family offices, Ohanian says, though he declined to name any. More important to Ohanian: Of the investment teams as its backers, Seven Seven Six targeted a base of 50% women and 15% Black or indigenous investors. \u201cWe\u2019ve ended up with some esteemed institutional investors as well as family offices who have never invested in venture before,\u201d Ohanian adds. \u201cWe\u2019re asking folks to self-report anonymously . . . I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll hit those.\u201d\n\nWhen the responses are in, Seven Seven Six plans to share all the data on its website. This is \u201cbuilding in public,\u201d a push for transparency\u2014and a way to stay in the eyes of potential customers, in this case, entrepreneurs\u2014that the firm is embracing throughout. For its recent operators-in-residence program, which commit to have three tech practitioners with different skill sets than Seven Seven Six\u2019s founders spend a year working with its portfolio and building its software, the firm ran an open application and published the results. Ditto its program to commit 2% on top of every first check at preseed and seed stage as nondilutive capital to support founders in \u201cpersonal growth\u201d and \u201ccaregiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we can better hold one another accountable, and make a lot of progress by sharing what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not,\u201d says Holloway, who was formerly vice president of people and culture at Reddit in Ohanian\u2019s second stint at the social media company, then joined him as a partner at Initialized Capital. \u201cWe really want to encourage other venture firms to do the same.\u201d\n\nOhanian and Garvin set out to launch Seven Seven Six, named after the original Olympic Games, last summer and were joined by Holloway several months later. All three were profoundly affected, they say, by the murder of George Floyd and subsequent Black Lives Matter protests and racial justice conversations that swept across the U.S. in following weeks. \u201cAlexis and I were having a lot of these conversations where I was just like, \u2018What can we do?\u2019\u201d says Garvin, who served as Ohanian\u2019s chief of staff at Reddit and Initialized, the firm Ohanian cofounded with Midas List investor Garry Tan. \u201cHaving the opportunity to start from zero, where you can be super-thoughtful and intentional, was really appealing to me.\u201d\n\nThat meant a split from Initialized, where Ohanian and Tan had built up a successful firm behind the likes of Coinbase, Instacart and Ro after starting to invest while partners at accelerator Y Combinator. Parties involved and those close to the two describe a drifting apart on fund strategy (such as an early-stage focus versus multistage approach) and operations (Ohanian, reached for this story over Zoom in a hotel room in Europe, is known for a wide array of ideas and projects, which he shares, often over Twitter, shooting from the hip.) In April, Tan called the split a \u201cconscious separation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud supporter of the team at 776,\u201d Tan wrote to Forbes this week. \u201cThey are stellar investors and we are excited to continue our close partnership over the years by co-investing and supporting the next generation\u2019s world-changing startups.\u201d \u201cI care a lot about Garry,\u201d Ohanian says. \u201cWe built something really great with Initialized and he will continue to have a big impact on tech,\u201d he adds, shouting out Tan\u2019s now-popular YouTube channel.\n\nThe biggest difference from Initialized: Seven Seven Six operates on Ohanian time, which means being fully remote, asynchronous and what to the outside world can seem a chaotic, if creative, blend of time zones and projects. \u201cWe often joke that he\u2019s the gas and we\u2019re the brake,\u201d says Holloway. \u201cOur job is to not flip the car.\u201d\n\nBefore showing off Cerebro over his hotel\u2019s iffy Wi-Fi\u2014including the status of an intro to a famous entertainment figure turned investor and more intel gleaned from tennis pre-match schmoozes we agreed not to name\u2014Ohanian argues that having worked a \u201csemi-remote\u201d work life for the past decade, he\u2019s well equipped to launch a post-pandemic new-look VC firm.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone switched to Zoom for a year, I felt like Bane in The Dark Knight Rises when he\u2019s telling Batman, \u2018You merely adopted the darkness. I was born in it, molded by it,\u2019\u201d Ohanian says in an enthusiastic impression of the villain played by Tom Hardy in the 2012 film.\n\nLike any firm, however, Seven Seven Six will ultimately be judged by its startup portfolio. The firm\u2019s largest check to date was a $20 million investment into Alt, a sports card business; while in Paris, he sent over a card of Roger Federer to the competitor himself, then tweeted it. Other recent investments include Dispo, the photo-sharing app that recently raised a Series A after cutting all ties with cofounder David Dobrik as the YouTube creator faced serious allegations. After promising to donate all profits from leading Dispo\u2019s seed investment to charity, Seven Seven Six participated in the new raise. \u201cThis team did nothing wrong, and we stand by them,\u201d Ohanian says. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019ve built an app people love that\u2019s going viral in a new country every couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThen, just before this story, Ohanian was tweeting about another investment: a $50 million Series B led into plant-based protein maker Simulate and its nuggets brand, Nuggs. For a $150 million early-stage fund, the investment appeared to be a head-scratcher. A source close with knowledge of the deal says Seven Seven Six\u2019s check was $10 million; it\u2019s also raised some special-purpose vehicles already that would lift its assets under management.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be the signal that kicks off a competitive round,\u201d Ohanian says of his back-then-hype approach. To hear him tell it, the \u201cgregarious\u201d persona he presents on social media isn\u2019t all for fun, but tactical marketing for his entrepreneurs and fund. When he\u2019s not working, he\u2019d just as soon log off to be with his daughter, Olympia, or play video games.\n\nBut even then, Ohanian\u2019s still likely to tweet about it to his more than 400,000 Twitter followers. The morning of this article\u2019s publication, he was online driving new followers to Seven Seven Six\u2019s Twitter account (it reached his 15,000 \u201claunch day\u201d target) and promoting a TV hit about the fund with a rocket ship gif.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming an asset to be your fullest and most authentic self online. Founders aren\u2019t taking money from a soulless corporate logo, they\u2019re taking money from people, and they want to know those people,\u201d Ohanian explains. If that\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, Ohanian\u2019s unbothered. \u201cI\u2019m at a point in my life where I know what I want to do and how I want to do it.\u201d",

            "content": "Schools are getting an unprecedented infusion of federal funds. To improve students\u2019 life chances, they should spend it on something that\u2019s generally overlooked: an elementary curriculum that builds academic knowledge.\n\nThe federal government is disbursing about $122 billion in education funding as part of the Biden administration\u2019s American Rescue Plan (ARP). Combined with pandemic-related funds already given out, the aid amounts to nearly $190 billion to be spent over the next two years. The effort is being called \u201cthe largest single federal investment in K-12 education we have ever seen.\u201d\n\nRather than trying to advance a specific vision of reform, as with Obama-era education grants, the money is just supposed to help schools reopen safely and \u201cexpand opportunity for students who need it most.\u201d States and districts have wide latitude on spending. The Department of Education\u2019s suggestions include everything from improving ventilation to extending \u201clearning and enrichment programs.\u201d\n\nLocal education officials who chafed under previous spending restrictions may be wishing for more guidance now. \u201cHow do we leverage one-time resources not to buy one-time things but to really change the system?\u201d Nebraska Chief Academic Officer Cory Epler has been quoted as asking. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about replacing every HVAC, but how can we also make sure every kid is ready for grade-level instruction so we don\u2019t lose our students with disabilities, English language learners, or students in poverty?\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Epler and anyone else asking those excellent questions, I have some thoughts:\n\nBe circumspect about the label \u201cevidence-based.\u201d The one requirement in the ARP is that districts use at least 20% of the funds on \u201cevidence-based interventions\u201d to address learning loss.\n\nThat sounds straightforward, but the term could just mean there\u2019s one study showing positive effects. Meanwhile, there could be\u2014and often are\u2014more studies that go the other way. Or the organization that runs the program might have decided not to publish studies that didn\u2019t come out the way they hoped.\n\nEven when an intervention is supported by lots of studies, they may only focus on short-term effects; many studies last only six weeks or less. To \u201creally change the system,\u201d you need long-term results.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to ask what an intervention is being compared to; if the control group got something unlikely to have much effect, there could be something else out there that would work even better. And there are some promising ideas that, for whatever reason, simply haven\u2019t been studied yet. They might be worth trying.\n\nNot all tutoring is the same. Tutoring is one of the few interventions backed by lots of evidence. Experts are recommending \u201chigh-dosage\u201d tutoring that\u2019s frequent and intensive, and many states and districts are including it in their plans.\n\nTutoring can work for math and foundational reading skills like phonics, which even many older students struggle with. But much if not most tutoring is directed at supposed reading comprehension skills: having kids practice \u201cfinding the main idea\u201d or \u201cmaking inferences,\u201d using easy-to-read books on random topics.\n\nThat approach mirrors the standard elementary curriculum, and it won\u2019t work any better with tutoring than it has in the classroom. Reading comprehension depends far more on academic knowledge and vocabulary than on abstract \u201cskill\u201d\u2014which is probably why studies show that with reading tutoring, there\u2019s \u201ca pattern of declining returns\u201d at higher grade levels. That\u2019s when texts start assuming more academic knowledge, and if kids haven\u2019t acquired it because they\u2019ve only been practicing comprehension \u201cskills,\u201d their comprehension will suffer.\n\nIdeally, schools would provide tutoring not just in math and phonics but also in the social studies or science topics covered in the curriculum, because those are the subjects most likely to build the knowledge that enables reading comprehension. But I\u2019m not aware of any large-scale tutoring programs in those areas. One reason may be that elementary schools have cut back on or eliminated those subjects to make more time for teaching comprehension \u201cskills.\u201d And if schools do spend time on those subjects, that\u2019s often when struggling readers are pulled from class for tutoring, which only risks putting them further behind.\n\nAdopt a knowledge-building elementary curriculum. This isn\u2019t one of the DOE\u2019s suggestions, but it\u2019s our best bet for addressing Covid-related learning loss\u2014as well as the learning loss that has been going on for decades for the most vulnerable students.\n\nBecause of the dominance of reading and math at lower grade levels, kids often arrive at high school without the background knowledge they need to succeed. That\u2019s particularly true if they\u2019ve had limited opportunities to acquire academic knowledge outside school. Our failure to systematically build kids\u2019 knowledge starting in kindergarten underlies the gap in test scores and other education outcomes between students at the upper and lower ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, a gap that has only gotten wider during the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s best to use the same curriculum across as many grades as possible. Building knowledge is a gradual, cumulative process. A consistent curriculum will help ensure kids have the background knowledge they need to understand and analyze the new information they\u2019re expected to learn.\n\nIs building knowledge \u201cevidence-based\u201d? There\u2019s plenty of evidence that background knowledge is hugely important to comprehension. There\u2019s also evidence that better curriculum can lead to significant gains in student achievement. But most of that evidence relates to math. There\u2019s less evidence that building kids\u2019 knowledge boosts reading comprehension, as reflected in standardized tests, largely because that kind of change can be difficult to measure. But the evidence that does exist is hugely promising.\n\nWhat about cost? A knowledge-building curriculum doesn\u2019t necessarily cost any more than one that doesn\u2019t build knowledge. States have regular cycles for adopting new curriculum, but there could be eight or ten years between \u201cwindows.\u201d Districts would be wise to use their Covid relief money to buy better curriculum as soon as possible, without waiting for another cycle.\n\nHow can you identify a knowledge-building curriculum? That can be tricky. An organization called Ed Reports was established in part to help, and its early ratings of literacy curricula were largely reliable. But recently Ed Reports has given high ratings to curricula that, like those that dominate the market, manage to be both ridiculously overstuffed and thin on content.\n\nI know of several elementary curricula that cover different bodies of knowledge in different ways. They all spend at least two or three weeks delving into a meaty topic, and they all expose every student in a class to challenging texts on those topics. A non-exhaustive list would include Core Knowledge Language Arts, Wit & Wisdom, Bookworms, and EL Education. No curriculum is perfect, but any of these will do a better job of equipping students for academic success than the standard approach.\n\nTrain teachers to implement the curriculum well. Simply adopting a knowledge-building curriculum isn\u2019t enough to ensure success. Many teachers will need intensive, ongoing support that\u2019s grounded in the specifics of the curriculum. An organization called Rivet Education can help schools and districts decide how to provide that.\n\nDon\u2019t stick with \u201cskills\u201d because of politics. In the current polarized environment, states and districts may be inclined to shy away from anything that specifies content, especially in social studies. But withholding academic knowledge from children and then holding them accountable for knowing it, as we currently do, is the essence of unfairness. And large majorities of students lack basic knowledge of history and civics, something that jeopardizes not only their own futures but the future of our democracy.\n\nIf no knowledge-building curriculum exactly suits your needs, supplement or tweak one. Those in left-leaning areas may feel that none of the knowledge-building options adequately centers the experience of Black and brown students. At the other end of the political spectrum, some may find certain texts or lessons in a curriculum too \u201cwoke.\u201d\n\nBut rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, districts should adopt an existing curriculum and add or substitute materials that cover what they feel is missing. Creating curriculum from scratch is hard, and most educators haven\u2019t been trained to do it.\n\nOne group of educators is publicly posting its efforts to supplement modules from EL Education to make them more culturally responsive. For a unit on the rainforest, for example, the group proposed additional texts on African rainforests and a poem by an indigenous writer.\n\nThe United States already spends over $700 billion a year on K-12 education, with little to show for it, especially for the most vulnerable students. For the sake of those students, let\u2019s do something fundamentally different with the $190 billion coming down the pike.",

            "description": "Garbage\u2019s Shirley Manson Thrives on Unapologetic Heroines  The New York Times",
            "content": "Back in the \u201990s, Shirley Manson never expected Garbage would still be making music together nearly 30 years later, and she suspects no one else did, either. \u201cWe\u2019re outliers,\u201d the fiery Scottish frontwoman said, referring to bandmates Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker. \u201cWe don\u2019t fit into any hip scene. We\u2019ve always done our own thing. I think that\u2019s really rare.\u201d The band\u2019s seventh album, \u201cNo Gods No Masters\u201d (out June 11), is its most socially conscious statement, a thrumming mix of goth and orchestral pop partially inspired by the racial justice movement, #MeToo revelations and escalating political divisions. \u201cAll these things that happened over the last few years caught my attention, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night if I just let that fly,\u201d Manson said via phone from the Los Angeles home she shares with her husband, the Garbage engineer Billy Bush, and their elderly rescue dog, Veela. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a party record. I wanted to make something that matters.\u201d Manson, 54, has also found a megaphone via her podcast \u201cThe Jump,\u201d for which she interviews fellow musicians like Angel Olsen and George Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve been so inspired at a time in my life when I needed inspiration,\u201d she said. Although, she added, the particularly personal track \u201cUncomfortably Me\u201d was aided by what the band calls Mind Erasers \u2014 a mezcal cocktail featuring chile liqueur. \u201cYou can only have one,\u201d she warned. \u201cThat song was written after two.\u201d Manson enthusiastically shared what else has sustained and influenced her throughout her long career. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my most cherished possessions, given to me on the day of my baptism by my father. It\u2019s got this beautiful, glossy cover with a picture of Jesus and some other folks on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, I think. My dad, strangely enough, is having struggles with his faith now at 84, but he was a devout believer, and he brought all of his children up in the church. I really took my studies seriously and, year after year, I won the religious education prize at school. Then the hormones kicked in and I started to notice the hypocrisy of organized religion. The slow eradication of my own faith broke my heart. I turned from perfect student to raging adolescent. I think I was furious at being hoodwinked. She was the first figure in the world that I crushed on. When I was 8, my dad took me to meet her at a local bookshop. And then I saw her dance with Rudolf Nureyev at a gala performance in Edinburgh. The ballet taught me what it meant to be artists and be disciplined and be serious, and also to work in partnership. Something about achieving things together taught me about how we have to pull each other up. Being a ballerina is the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to do in my life. Everything else that\u2019s ever happened to me, I didn\u2019t necessarily desire. But I had a terrible accident at church when I was 11 and I twisted my ankle badly. I could no longer sustain pointe. Now, instead of counting sheep to get myself to sleep, I imagine ballerinas running down a spiral staircase. My mother was a great music lover. She had a red leather Dansette record player, and she introduced me to Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee and Nina Simone. Listening to the records now reminds me of dancing with her in the kitchen. Nina Simone is probably my all time favorite singer \u2014 the sound of her voice, her phrasing, her cadences. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard anything as shocking and heartbreaking as \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d or \u201cI Loves You, Porgy,\u201d which I didn\u2019t understand as a kid. Now the profundity of it hits me so hard. I\u2019m attracted to her courage and her willingness not to be liked. She could be fierce and intimidating. It\u2019s unusual enough now, but back then that was revolutionary.\n\nI was in music class the morning we all found out that John Lennon had been killed. I had an amazing music teacher and she allowed us to sit and cry, and she wept with us. I pored over the news regarding Yoko Ono and her grief as a widow. I\u2019d always had a lack of interest in Yoko, because I bought into the ways that she had been sidelined by misogyny. That is the tragedy. But over the years, I\u2019m astounded by what a pioneer she is, not just in art but in gender and environmental politics. I was so lucky to be invited by Gxrlschool L.A. to perform a tribute to her at the Disney Concert Hall, and I got to sing \u201cWhat a Bastard the World Is.\u201d At the end of the performance I got a note that Yoko wanted to meet me. I\u2019m giving myself goose bumps just talking about it. I\u2019m always chasing Pris \u2014 in my dreams, in my stage performances, in my fantasies. I grew up in the \u201970s in Scotland. There were topless models in the newspapers. To see someone that I knew most men would find freaky when I found her alluring and androgynous just freed me from believing that I had to play a certain game. Pris formed a taste in me for something outside of the typical male gaze. Suddenly, I was like [expletive] it. I don\u2019t want to be a boring woman. I was in London. Garbage had just been dropped by Interscope Records. My career was in the toilet. I was creeping up on 40 in an industry that\u2019s not kind to women who are over 25. I was hanging out with the video director Sophie Muller and her old art-school teacher said to us, \u201cGo to the Tate and see the retrospective on Louise Bourgeois.\u201d We became groupies. At the time, Louise Bourgeois was 95, and she was still painting. And standing in the middle of the Tate reading up on her, a darkness broke out of me. I was like, you know what? I may no longer have a successful career, but I can still be an artist. I was overtaken with a determination to engineer my own life. During quarantine, I had my whole brain exploded by this series. I had always thought of jazz as something fusty and sort of conservative \u2014 it\u2019s always been a closed door to me. \u201cJazz\u201d really shook me up. It gave me a phenomenal basis in understanding contemporary American music and an incredible perspective on systematic racism, colonialism and also great genius. I\u2019m on my third season now and it causes me unbelievable amounts of stress. I feel like I\u2019m not smart enough to be in the position that I\u2019m in. However, it has been an extraordinarily rewarding experience. When you sit down with people for a couple of hours, you get their energy.\n\nI came away from the studio really loving on Liz Phair. My band was working on a track, and I wanted to write something that was a little scathing about the patriarchy, but I wanted it to be fun. And I went into the vocal booth and I deliberately pitched my voice low the way she does. 9. Patrisse Cullors and Asha Bandele\u2019s \u201cWhen They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir\u201d It was one of the first books I read a couple of years ago when I suddenly had this na\u00efve realization that, gun to the head, I wouldn\u2019t be able to name you 10 Black movie directors. Ten Black novelists. I feel embarrassed to say this. I really needed to educate myself about what\u2019s going on in this country and around the globe. \u201cWhen They Call You a Terrorist\u201d just set me on a whole journey of belated understanding of the struggle of Black, brown and Indigenous people. I then watched \u201cThe 13th,\u201d an incredible documentary by Ava DuVernay. It\u2019s really difficult for white people to admit to our own prejudice, our own privilege, our own conditioning. But you can get over your embarrassment, because people are actually suffering. Whenever she speaks, I just start crying. I went to see her perform at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2005 and I started to weep because she looked so powerful, like some kind of vision. She didn\u2019t even seem human. And then I saw her speak just before lockdown to promote her book \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d and I wept all the way through that, too. I always think my relationship to her is singular, but I went to the bathroom and all the other ladies in there were crying, too. It was like a Backstreet Boys concert. I\u2019ve seen a lot of my heroes age, and you watch them lose their confidence as they move through the world. You start to see them apologize for aging. With Patti Smith, there is no apology, and it\u2019s such a potent message.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe story of voting rights in the United States looks less like a graph of exponential growth and more like a sine wave; there are highs and lows, peaks and plateaus. President Biden captured this reality in his address on Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where he spoke on the gathering threat to our democracy from the Republican Party\u2019s twin efforts to suppress rival constituencies and seize control of state voting apparatuses. \u201cThere is an unfolding assault taking place in America today,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAn attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are \u2014 who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\nBiden is also right to say, as he did throughout the speech, that these attacks are \u201cnot unprecedented.\u201d He pointed to Jim Crow and the \u201cpoll taxes and literacy tests and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d For obvious reasons, Jim Crow takes center stage in these discussions. But we should remember that it was part of a wave of suffrage restrictions aimed at working-class groups across the country: Black people in the South, Chinese Americans in the West and European immigrants in the North.\n\u2022 Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that \"only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022\" and beyond.\n\u2022 Matthew Continetti writes that \u201ctime and again, the biggest obstacle to a red wave hasn\u2019t been the Democratic Party. It\u2019s been the Republican Party.\u201d\n\u2022 Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.\n\u2022 Michelle Cottle examines two primary contests that \u201cwill shake the parties well beyond the states in play.\u201d \u201cThe tide of democratic faith was at low ebb on all American shores after the Grant administration, and it would be a mistake to fix upon a reactionary temper in the South as a sectional peculiarity,\u201d the historian C. Vann Woodward wrote in \u201cOrigins of the New South, 1877-1913.\u201d For as much as Jim Crow dominates our collective memory of voting restrictions, it is the attack on suffrage in the North in those last decades of the 19th century that might actually be more relevant to our present situation.\n\nThe current assault on voting is a backlash, in part, to the greater access that marked the 2020 presidential election. More mail-in and greater early voting helped push turnout to modern highs. In the same way, the turn against universal manhood suffrage came after its expansion in the wake of the Civil War. A growing number of voters were foreign-born, the result of mass immigration and the rapid growth of an immigrant working class in the industrial centers of the North. \u201cBetween 1865 and World War I,\u201d wrote the historian Alexander Keyssar in \u201cThe Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,\u201d \u201cnearly 25 million immigrants journeyed to the United States, accounting for a large proportion of the nation\u2019s World War I population of roughly 100 million.\u201d A vast majority arrived without property or the means to acquire it. Some were the Irish and Germans of previous waves of immigration, but many more were Eastern and Southern Europeans, with alien languages, exotic customs and unfamiliar faiths. \u201cBy 1910,\u201d noted Keyssar, \u201cmost urban residents were immigrants or the children of immigrants, and the nation\u2019s huge working class was predominantly foreign-born, native-born of foreign parents or Black.\u201d To Americans of older stock, this was a disaster in waiting. And it fueled among them a backlash to the democratic expansion that followed the Civil War. \u201cA New England village of the olden time \u2014 that is to say, of some 40 years ago \u2014 would have been safely and well governed by the votes of every man in it,\u201d Francis Parkman, a prominent historian and a member in good standing of the Boston elite, wrote in an 1878 essay called \u201cThe Failure of Universal Suffrage.\u201d but, now that the village has grown into a populous city, with its factories and workshops, its acres of tenement-houses and thousands and ten thousands of restless workmen, foreigners for the most part, to whom liberty means license and politics means plunder, to whom the public good is nothing and their own most trivial interests everything, who love the country for what they can get out of it and whose ears are open to the promptings of every rascally agitator, the case is completely changed, and universal suffrage becomes a questionable blessing. In \u201cThe Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880-1910,\u201d the historian J. Morgan Kousser took note of William L. Scruggs, a turn-of-the-century scholar and diplomat who gave a similarly colorful assessment of universal suffrage in an 1884 article, \u201cRestriction of the Suffrage\u201d: The idea of unqualified or \u201ctramp\u201d suffrage, like communism, with which it is closely allied, seems to be of modern origin; and, like that and kindred isms, it usually finds advocates and apologists in the ranks of the discontented, improvident, ignorant, vicious, depraved and dangerous classes of society. It is not indigenous to the soil of the United States. It originated in the slums of European cities, and, like the viper in the fable, has been nurtured into formidable activity in this country by misdirected kindness. Beyond their presumed immorality and vice, the problem with new immigrant voters, from the perspective of these elites, was that they undermined so-called good government. \u201cThere is not the slightest doubt in my own mind that our prodigality with the suffrage has been the chief source of the corruption of our elections,\u201d wrote the Progressive-era political scientist John W. Burgess in an 1895 article titled \u201cThe Ideal of the American Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nThis claim, that Black and immigrant voters were venal and corrupt \u2014 that they voted either illegally or irresponsibly \u2014 was common. Charges of corruption and naturalization fraud were repeated endlessly: electoral outcomes were twisted by \u201cnaturalization mills\u201d that, with the aid of \u201cprofessional perjurers and political manipulators,\u201d transformed thousands of immigrants into citizens in the weeks before elections. Out of this furious attack on universal male suffrage (and also, in other corners, the rising call for women\u2019s suffrage) came a host of efforts to purify the electorate, spearheaded by progressive reformers in both parties. Lawmakers in Massachusetts passed \u201cpauper exclusions\u201d that disqualified from voting any men who received public relief on the day of the election. Republican lawmakers in New Jersey, targeting immigrant-dominated urban political machines in the state, required naturalized citizens to show naturalization documents to election officials before voting, intentionally burdening immigrants who did not have their papers or could not find them. Lawmakers in Connecticut endorsed an English literacy requirement, and California voters amended their state Constitution to disenfranchise any person \u201cwho shall not be able to read the Constitution in the English language and write his name,\u201d a move meant to keep Chinese and Mexican Americans from the ballot box. The introduction of the secret ballot and the polling booth made voting less communal and put an additional premium on literacy \u2014 if you couldn\u2019t read the ballot, and if no one was allowed to assist, then how were you supposed to make a choice? If suffrage restriction in the South was a blunt weapon meant to cleave entire communities from the body politic, then suffrage restriction in the North was a twisting maze of obstacles meant to block anyone without the means or education to overcome them. There were opponents of this effort to shrink democracy. They lost. Voter turnout crashed in the first decades of the 20th century. Just 48.9 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in the 1924 presidential election, an all-time low. \u201cThere were fewer Republicans in the South because of Jim Crow voter suppression and fewer Democrats in the North because of the active discouragement of working-class urban immigrant voters,\u201d the historian Jon Grinspan noted in \u201cThe Age of Acrimony: How Americans Fought to Fix Their Democracy, 1865-1915.\u201d \u201cThe efforts of 50 years of restrainers had succeeded. A new political culture had been born: one that had been cleaned and calmed, stifled and squelched.\u201d It would take decades, and an epochal movement for civil rights, before the United States even came close to the democratic highs it reached in the years after Appomattox. With all of that in mind, let\u2019s return to Biden\u2019s speech. There was an urgency in what the president said in defense of voting rights, a sense that now is the only time left to act. \u201cLook how close it came,\u201d he said in reference to the attack on Congress on Jan. 6 and the effort to overturn the election. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now.\u201d",

In \u201cThe Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880-1910,\u201d the historian J. Morgan Kousser took note of William L. Scruggs, a turn-of-the-century scholar and diplomat who gave a similarly colorful assessment of universal suffrage in an 1884 article, \u201cRestriction of the Suffrage\u201d: If suffrage restriction in the South was a blunt weapon meant to cleave entire communities from the body politic, then suffrage restriction in the North was a twisting maze of obstacles meant to block anyone without the means or education to overcome them.",

            "content": "Nearly every week, it seems there's a new disturbing video or news report of attacks on Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders in the United States.\n\nHere are 13 sites that might provide a deeper understanding of the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and beyond. Be sure to check with the sites before visiting as hours and operations may have changed during the pandemic.\n\nLocated on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, the US Immigration Station (USIS) was the main entry point for immigration from Asia after it opened in 1910. Also known as the \"Ellis Island of the West,\" nearly 500,000 people from 80 countries were processed or detained there between 1910 and 1940.\n\nMany of those detained were Chinese because of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the first law to restrict immigration based on race. This law allowed for only certain exempt groups of Chinese to immigrate to the US, which resulted in an influx of immigrants with fake documentation.\n\nIn an effort to uphold the Chinese Exclusion Act, authorities subjected many Chinese immigrants to rigorous interrogations on Angel Island. They were held in unsanitary and deficient quarters, anywhere from several weeks to several months before being deported or being allowed to enter the country.\n\nToday, USIS serves as a museum dedicated to the history of immigration in the United States. For many visitors, the most moving moment is seeing more than 200 poems chiseled into the walls by detainees.\n\nDetails and tips: To visit, take the Angel Island/San Francisco ferry to the island and then take a scenic hike, tram ride or bicycle the 1.5-mile journey from the dock to the site, located inside Angel Island State Park. General admission is $5, and guided tours are available Wednesday through Sunday.\n\nThis national historic landmark in Honolulu previously housed Hawaiian monarchs, including the Hawaiian Kingdom's last two rulers, King Kalakaua and Queen Liliuokalani. Completed in 1882, Iolani Palace features Italian Renaissance-style architecture.\n\nAfter the monarchy was overthrown and an attempt to restore Queen Liliuokalani to the throne failed, she was charged with treason and imprisoned in 1895 in an upstairs bedroom for almost eight months.\n\nAfter serving for decades as government offices, the palace was restored and opened to the public in 1978.\n\nFounded by art collectors Shireen and Afzal Ahmad, the South Asia Institute features art acquired over more than 45 years ranging from miniature paintings from India's Mughal Empire to contemporary South Asian art.\n\n\"The Sindhu Project: Enigma of Roots\" will be debuting on June 10, showcasing an artistic interpretation of archaeological sites and artifacts across northwest India and Pakistan.\n\nDetails and tips: The SAI is open by appointment only while the facility installs its upcoming exhibit. Email info@saichicago.org. An online exhibit called \"Diasporic Rhizome\" explores how 21 participating South Asian artists interpret the concept of diaspora.\n\nThis 17-ton, elaborately engraved bronze bell in the Korean-American Peace Park section of Angels Gate Park was gifted to the United States by South Korea in 1976 to celebrate the friendship between the two countries and the bicentennial of US independence.\n\nKorean American actor Philip Ahn spearheaded the efforts to deliver the gift. The Korean Bell of Friendship was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1978. The bell is rung on several holidays, including Korean American Day on January 13.\n\nDetails and tips: The community of San Pedro is about 25 miles south of central Los Angeles.

About 10,000 Cambodians live in Minnesota -- most came in the 1970s as war refugees fleeing the Khmer Rouge regime -- and it's a significant spiritual and meeting place for the community.\n\nThe 40-acre complex features an old temple that serves as the monks' dwelling, plus shrines, meditation and gathering halls and the ornately designed 60-foot-tall main temple structure.\n\nDetails and tips: Mid-April is the most festive time to visit, as thousands gather to celebrate Cambodian New Year.

Visitors should bring cash for the donation boxes.\n\nFilipino farmers played a significant role in the agricultural worker movement in the 1960s, and the Paolo Agbayani Retirement Village was built by the movement via volunteer labor to support elderly Filipino farm workers in 1974.\n\nThe Chamorro -- Guam's indigenous people -- arrived in Guam roughly 4,500 years ago from Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Visit the Senator Angel Leon Guerrero Santos Latte Stone Memorial Park in Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, Guam, to marvel at the ancient stone structures known as latte stones.\n\nServing as foundations for Chamorro homes, each features a circular bowl-like rock known as a \"tasa\" stacked atop a stone pillar. The tallest is almost 20 feet tall, and the oldest dates back 1,500 years. No other culture is known to have used latte stones.\n\nDetails and tips: After your visit to the park, take an easy five-minute walk to the Dulce Nombre de Maria Agana Cathedral and Basilica built by the first missionary in Guam in the 17th century.\n\nA recently opened exhibit called \"Hakone Gardens and Executive Order 9066\" tells the story of Hakone gardener and caretaker James Sasaki and his family's internment at the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah.\n\nThe gardens and estate, including an Upper House and Lower House featuring traditional Japanese architecture, were created for philanthropists Isabel and Oliver Stine by Japanese imperial gardener Naoharu Aihara, architect Tsunematsu Shintani and numerous artisans in the early 1900s. It is now run by the Hakone Foundation.\n\nDetails and tips: General admission is $10. A public tea ceremony is held on the first Sunday of the month from April to November.

The site was chosen because it is close to the Cambridge birthplace of Bhumibol.\n\nDetails and tips: Guided tours are available for groups of 10 or more, or you can explore the temple on your own. There are also free yoga classes, meditation groups, Dhamma talks and Sangha chanting available on-site.\n\nEstablished in 1869, the 272-acre Wakamatsu Farm was the site of the first Japanese settlement in the United States. Issei migrants used their farming skills here and planted tea, mulberry for silkworms, persimmon, bamboo and rice.\n\nThe Wakamatsu Farm is still active, leasing 110 acres of lands to independent farming operations for livestock and crops. On-site, there are many activities available such as visiting the on-site tea house, a wheelchair-accessible lake trail and more. The farm also serves as an event venue.\n\nDetails and tips: The Wakamatsu Farm is privately owned by the American River Conservancy, which purchased the property in 2010. Visitors should view their calendar for events and tours. Docent tours are available if scheduled at least two weeks ahead. Visitors are also welcome for open farm days to hike, picnic and tour the grounds.",

            "content": "A social historian looking for a defense of the Black Power movement in popular magazines and newspapers of the 1960s would have to do a great deal of digging. Such an inquirer would have an easier time quarrying the pages of Triumph, a little-remembered Catholic periodical started by L. Brent Bozell, a brother-in-law of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of National Review. In January 1967, the editors of Triumph suggested that Black Power could help to restore \u201cliberty and human dignity to America.\u201d Liberals congratulating themselves over the passage of major civil rights legislation, the magazine argued, were unaware of how they were still \u201cbarbarizing\u201d Black people, who rightly understood that human dignity transcended mere legal recognition of their constitutional rights. The editors would go even further than this. To these decidedly reactionary Roman Catholic laymen \u2014 Mr. Bozell had only recently returned with his family from Francisco Franco\u2019s Spain \u2014 rioting was an understandable response to the \u201cterror that always haunts men confronted by meaninglessness,\u201d the actions of a people \u201cyearning to make contact with the divine.\u201d For Triumph, Black Power was a rebellion against the \u201csoulless tyranny of secular liberalism,\u201d and its adherents were worthy of praise because \u201calmost alone among our brethren they seem willing to burst violently through the flesh into the realm of the spirit.\u201d When I began reading through the archives of Triumph several years ago, I found these arguments striking. This was not because they seemed to offer a wholly accurate assessment of the state of American race relations in the late \u201960s. (Among other things, many at the magazine ignored the reality that millions of African Americans were quite pleased with the decidedly sublunary consolations of equal protection under the law and held correspondingly unromantic views about rioting.)\n\nWhat struck me, rather, was that the editors, who also called for unilateral nuclear disarmament and were among the founders of the nascent pro-life movement, were doing something that even now, in a nation of some 65 million Catholics, seems impossibly radical: setting aside the standard ideological divisions of coalition politics in an attempt to apply the full range of the church\u2019s social teaching to the problems of modern life. It is certainly difficult to imagine anything like the magazine\u2019s defense of the Black Power movement appearing in a conservative Catholic periodical today. Last year, the radio host Gloria Purvis was fired from her position with the Eternal Word Television Network, the largest Catholic broadcasting company in the United States, after suggesting that her co-religionists should be outraged by the death of George Floyd. (Her dismissal would almost certainly have baffled the network\u2019s founder, Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation, who was inspired by the civil rights movement to start a religious community near Birmingham, Ala., that would appeal to African American women.) Instead of commentary informed by the official teachings of the Catholic Church, much of what issues from the American Catholic press on the subject of race relations is indistinguishable from the competing perspectives on offer in secular media, with some Catholic liberals uncritically endorsing organizations such as Black Lives Matter, which has called for the displacement of the traditional nuclear family, and some on the right employing casuistry in defense of Mr. Floyd\u2019s murder. This is the case despite the fact that on race and so many other issues, it is clear that distinctly Catholic positions \u2014 which is to say, responses formed by papal encyclicals, the lives and writings of the saints, the traditions of academic theology and natural law philosophy \u2014 do not line up with the mainstream of either progressive or conservative opinion in this country. This is why pronouncements from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops often appear to those unfamiliar with the church\u2019s social teaching as if they were the work of two very different entities: in favor of looser immigration policies, prudent stewardship of the environment and criminal sentencing reform, yet opposed to abortion, same-sex marriage and divorce. While it is certainly true that the relative weight assigned to each of these issues by individuals within the American episcopate varies, even the most \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d bishops are more likely to agree with one another than they are with prominent politicians in either of our two major political parties. I express these concerns about the integrity of the church\u2019s public witness because I believe that a thoughtfully articulated Catholic politics has a great deal to offer our officially secular republic. After all, ever since St. John XXIII\u2019s encyclical \u201cPacem in Terris\u201d was addressed in 1963 to \u201call men of good will,\u201d the implied audience for Catholic social teaching has extended well beyond the Catholic faithful, not least because the church has always maintained that moral truth is available to all men and women by the light of reason alone.\n\nToday, perhaps more than ever, the church presents a refreshing response to our nation\u2019s enforced ideological bifurcation. Polling suggests that about 75 percent of Americans have moderate to progressive views on economic questions and slightly more than half are socially conservative. The median voter has both of these traits, and there are good reasons to think that it was this unnamed coalition of anti-libertarians who decided the outcomes of the last two presidential elections. Both of our major political parties try to placate voters by triangulating occasionally, tactically co-opting stances from the other side. But the most striking thing about both parties is the wide range of positions they share that are at odds with the enthusiasms of the median voter: a bellicose foreign policy, free trade, social libertinism and the financialization of the economy. In contrast, the church offers a consistent ethic of solidarity: against pre-emptive war of any kind (which the church tells us cannot be waged in a just manner under modern conditions), against the enrichment of the wealthy in poor and rich nations alike at the expense of the working and middle classes, against the increasingly nebulous claims of academic progressives and activists about the nature of the human person and against the pursuit of maximal shareholder value to the detriment of virtually every other meaningful consideration. It is not just the wide range of issues addressed by the church\u2019s social teaching that might inform a future large-scale political realignment but also the manner in which it does so. Consider the problem of cooperation among nations. If the events of the last year have revealed anything, it is the importance of what Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, referred to as supranational institutions with \u201creal teeth.\u201d Instead of lionizing the neoliberal banalities of Davos Man, Catholic social teaching articulates a morally inflected defense of internationalism that rejects most of what makes Americans suspicious of it \u2014 the obliging attitude toward corporate power, the soft cultural imperialism of liberal nongovernmental organizations \u2014 while insisting upon its indispensability for the common good. The idea that Catholic social teaching can inspire secular politics is not new. The papal encyclicals of the interwar period, which spoke to the anxieties of a world torn between the failures of laissez-faire economics and the growing threat of totalitarianism, were read enthusiastically by Franklin Roosevelt. Today Pope Francis, in keeping with many recent occupants of the Chair of Peter, addresses his writings to \u201call people of good will\u201d rather than to the Catholic faithful alone as he inveighs against the spoliation of the Amazon region and its Indigenous peoples, wage slavery in Asia, the theft of natural resources in Africa and the replacement of civic life with algorithm-abetted consumerism in the developed world. We already have a test case for what Catholic social teaching can offer to a population disillusioned by the collapse of a civilization and its supposed ideals: the European political tradition of Christian democracy. More than half a century ago, Christian democracy arose in Europe as a response to the ideologies that had given rise to a global economic depression and two successive world wars. The new postnationalist Europe to which this political movement gave rise \u2014 a Europe of robust trade unions and generously subsidized orchestras \u2014 was the dream not only of the onetime imperial heir Otto von Hapsburg and Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, the longtime prefect of the Holy Office, but also of Goethe and Schiller and Beethoven, the fulfillment of the promise of centuries of European humanism. Like its predecessor in Europe, a revived Christian democracy in the United States would draw upon official church teaching as well as pilfer from the best of secular culture. A new Catholic politics would \u201cbaptize\u201d Bernie Sanders\u2019s health care plan, degrowth economics and bans on single-use plastics while drawing attention to neglected elements of our own political heritage that really are worth preserving, such as the presumption of innocence. Such a politics would also remind us, in ways that transcend politics in the narrow sense, of the value of forgiveness and contrition, as opposed to the self-aggrandizing quasi-therapeutic apologies to which we have become accustomed from public figures.\n\nThe prospects for a politics informed by the church\u2019s social teaching will be limited, of course, in the absence of an equally thoughtful Catholic culture, one that allows us to escape what Cardinal Robert Sarah calls the \u201cdictatorship of noise.\u201d A Catholic culture worthy of the name would be a catholic one \u2014 which is to say, it would be capacious in spirit. It would model virtues such as gregariousness, intellectual curiosity and munificence. It would offer an unapologetic defense of leisure and innocent entertainment by showing us the innate worthiness of everything from public barbecue grills and minor league baseball to regional theater companies and the miracle of hi-fi recording. Such a culture would hold up to a world of faddishness those immortal words of St. Paul in his Epistle to the Philippians: \u201cFinally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d",

Instead of lionizing the neoliberal banalities of Davos Man, Catholic social teaching articulates a morally inflected defense of internationalism that rejects most of what makes Americans suspicious of it \u2014 the obliging attitude toward corporate power, the soft cultural imperialism of liberal nongovernmental organizations \u2014 while insisting upon its indispensability for the common good. The idea that Catholic social teaching can inspire secular politics is not new.

Your breath is clean, it feels like the right thing to do,\u201d he said during a Zoom call from Deauville, France, where he moved from New York City last fall to ride out the pandemic. \u201cAnd then you read about higher cancer rates for people who used it, and how it destroys good and bad bacteria, and you go, \u2018You\u2019re right, there was no mouthwash back then.\u2019\u201d \u201cBack then\u201d is the ancient world, from which Mr. Skallas draws an inexhaustible supply of practical lessons.\n\nThe Lindy Effect can be traced to a 1964 article in The New Republic called \u201cLindy\u2019s Law,\u201d by the historian Albert Goldman, who described the \u201cbald-headed, cigar-chomping know-it-alls who foregather every night at Lindy\u2019s,\u201d the diner then on Broadway known for its cheesecake, and postulated that since comedians have an exhaustible supply of good material, the \u201clife expectancy of a television comedian is proportional to the total amount of his exposure on the medium.\u201d Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a statistician and scholar, tweaked this idea into a broad theory of survivability in his 2012 book, \u201cAntifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.\u201d He named it the Lindy Effect: \u201cFor the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy.\u201d\n\nFor example, a play that has run on Broadway for five years will likely stick around for five more. He concluded: \u201cThe robustness of an item is proportional to its life!\u201d Mr. Taleb argued that the Lindy Effect helps explain why so many seemingly earthshaking new developments end up forgotten or disproved. For example, many scientists have spent the last decade in a state of alarm about the \u201creplication\u201d crisis: that many findings turn out not to hold up when other scientists repeat the studies. Here are more fascinating tales you can\u2019t help but read all the way to the end.\n\u2022 None\n\u2022 As the population of the Isle of Rum in the \u200b\u200bScottish Hebrides soars to 40, residents ponder the future of their remote and rainy home.\n\u2022 Ron Perelman, the billionaire businessman who controls Revlon, seemed to have everything. Until the bill arrived.\n\u2022 With the death of Ruth Willig at 98, a Times series on a set of the oldest New Yorkers \u2014 chronicled over seven years in 21 articles \u2014 offers their lessons on living with loss. Inaccurate science, in other words, is constantly being published. The Lindy-conscious consumer of scientific data will take seriously only information that has held up over a period of time. Lindy, he wrote in a 2017 post on Medium, cannot be fooled: \u201cThe only effective judge of things is time.\u201d Mr. Skallas has long followed and read Mr. Taleb, with whom he shares a fascination with the ancient world. He even once managed to elicit a rare correction from the scholar after disproving an assertion in one of Mr. Taleb\u2019s books, which claimed the ancients did not have a word for the color blue. While Mr. Taleb primarily discussed the Lindy Effect as in terms of statistics and social science, Mr. Skallas has expounded at length about the practical applications of Lindy when it comes to diet, health, dating, exercise and practically everything else. He has become something of a lifestyle guru to thousands of Twitter followers and newsletter readers: think Goop or Joe Rogan by way of the Bronze Age.\n\nLindy is not Luddism: Mr. Skallas is an avid social media user, after all. Rather, he scours the ancient world for applicable nuggets of what he calls \u201cuseful tradition,\u201d using the Lindy Effect\u2019s heuristic of older is better as a \u201cbulwark against consumerism,\u201d to sift through the \u201ctons of products coming out every day.\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the store, I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at skepticism of modern commercial life.\u201d Mr. Skallas endorses practices with a basis in antiquity, like intermittent fasting, which appears across religious traditions and has demonstrable health benefits (though also detractors). \u201cYour body gets stronger through stressors, and it gets stronger through the lack of food,\u201d he said. He follows a diet drawn from Greek Orthodox tradition, alternating between veganism and pescatarianism (today some call this serial cycling). A tweet from his account @LindyDiet laid out further specifics: \u201cFast 2 times a week (vegan or abstain from food) and a month straight 2 times a year.\u201d\n\nSomewhat akin to the advocates of the paleo diet, Mr. Skallas recommends avoiding eating any foods or beverages invented in the past 500 years. This means no Beyond Beef, Monster Energy or Go-Gurt but yes to mutton, hot cross buns and the like. \u201cCoffee is relatively new,\u201d he said, acknowledging the arbitrariness of the cutoff. \u201cIt\u2019s 400 years old, but that\u2019s 400 years of pretty good filtering, and it\u2019s probably not bad for you.\u201d Tea merits his highest compliment: It\u2019s a \u201cdeep Lindy\u201d beverage, with thousands of years of provenance. Cigarettes, a 20th-century vice, are not Lindy, though tobacco is; for those who want to smoke in a \u201cLindy compatible way,\u201d he suggests a pipe. Mr. Skallas eschews modern exercise machines, urging his readers in a newsletter post to stick with simple weight lifting, citing Milos of Croton, the mythical Greek bodybuilder who lifted a calf daily until he could hoist the adult bull. \u201cBodybuilding culture is some grotesque subculture that is a product of modernity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorking out isn\u2019t about the muscles, but about the other systems in your body, interconnected to each other.\u201d\n\nMr. Skallas, who spends his work day reading contracts, does not see himself as a self-help figure or a philosopher. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Jordan Peterson thing,\u201d he said, referring to the Canadian philosopher whose books offer advice directed at young men. \u201cI\u2019m not into motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018Whoa, look at this.\u2019\u201d He will confidently diagnose the Lindy-ness of most anything. Sleek midcentury modernism? \u201cAnytime you get away from fractal patterns and ornate details, it\u2019s not Lindy.\u201d How about sex toys? \u201cLindy,\u201d he said, adding, by way of explanation, \u201cancient Egypt.\u201d The Jeffrey Epstein scandal? \u201cSome rich guy going around and doing criminal behavior and abusing people? It\u2019s pretty Lindy!\u201d Epstein, he pointed out, exemplified how Lindy is not a moral compass; lots of common behaviors in the ancient world would be considered abhorrent today.\n\nYet the persistence of behaviors across millenniums makes the lessons of antiquity potent. \u201cHuman nature doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. The ancients \u201creally did study the person and how people act, and some of it is quite good.\u201d Therapy, for example, is something he believes in, but not because he holds stock in the theories of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud; rather, he argued, therapy works because the therapist embodies the deep Lindy role of a sympathetic friend in the alienating modern world. Of course, the Lindy effect doesn\u2019t work in every domain; if you are diagnosed with cancer, seek chemotherapy, Mr. Skallas said, rather than relying on Roman medical practices. He thinks Lindy is more useful when it comes to skepticism of industrial-age consumables, like mouthwash or processed seed oils, and faddish social science, like the debunked Myers-Briggs test. And ancient practices can provide powerful inchoate benefits to their practitioners, even when the exact cause and effect may be unclear at the time. In his newsletter, Mr. Skallas cited the 2016 book \u201cThe Secret of Our Success,\u201d by Joseph Henrich, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard. Mr. Heinrich researched the history of manioc, a bitter root domesticated in South America, which can be toxic if not prepared properly. In the Amazon, \u201cIndigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots,\u201d to remove cyanide.\n\nA Lindy walk isn\u2019t just a beeline from Point A to Point B; there should be no set destination, with turns made at random to stimulate the mind. \u201cAn interesting thing happened when I walked. I had thoughts popping into my head,\u201d Mr. Skallas wrote. \u201cWaves of ideas would come through. I wasn\u2019t \u2018trying\u2019 to think or even come up with an idea. It would just appear. Like magic.\u201d Many of Mr. Skallas\u2019s readers began taking daily Lindy walks and posting about them on social media, and the term has now spread beyond his immediate readership. \u201cEssentially it\u2019s just conscious habit forming, but I think the cute name for some reason makes it more enticing and endearing,\u201d as one follower put it. Mr. Skallas thinks the pandemic \u2014 itself deep Lindy (\u201cthey put on a mask 500 years ago, right?\u201d) \u2014 opened people\u2019s eyes to the worldview by evoking ancient, world-historical dangers that many had felt insulated from. \u201cI think before this pandemic hit, we were living in a time of, \u2018Hey, man, we\u2019re untouchable,\u2019\u201d he said. But quarantine forced many to begin \u201cthinking about scarcity,\u201d and ask themselves, \u201cWhat is Lindy? Like, what is the stuff you need in this life?\u201d Vaccination was among those things, and so the next time Mr. Skallas was contacted for this article, he was in Chicago, where he\u2019d traveled for his shot. He wrote in an email that although he wasn\u2019t giving up his day job just yet, a book (very Lindy) might be in the works.",

            "content": "California\u2019s governor proposes adding a full school year before kindergarten. How will it work?\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed far-reaching, multibillion-dollar education initiatives \u2014 including a full year of schooling for all 4-year-olds and enrichment programs and tutoring for students in low-income communities \u2014 aimed at those he sees as most in need as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes.\n\nIf approved by the Legislature, the governor\u2019s plans, which his administration pencils out at $20 billion over several years, would represent an ambitious expansion of the mission for California\u2019s education system.\n\nFunded by a massive influx of state income tax revenue, Newsom\u2019s proposal first and foremost targets universal transitional kindergarten, promising an additional year on the front end of the kindergarten-through-12th-grade public school experience.\n\nBut it also includes $1 billion a year for additional after-school and summer programs in low-income communities \u2014 building up to $5 billion. Here\u2019s more about how it would work and why many experts are praising the effort.\n\nShould She Go to the Border?\n\nAfter President Biden made Vice President Kamala Harris his diplomatic envoy to Latin America to address the \u201croot causes\u201d of the increase in the number of unaccompanied children and families trying to enter the United States, Republicans have demanded to know why she hasn\u2019t visited the border.\n\nEven some some Democrats, nonpartisan policy experts and immigrant advocacy groups also say Harris should visit the border as a high-level sign of the administration\u2019s commitment to fixing the battered immigration system and so that Harris can witness the scope of the problem she has been asked to help fix.\n\nHarris, so far, has resisted making plans to visit, pointing out that her job description involves diplomacy in Latin America rather than policy at the border. She will fly over it next month for two days of meetings with the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala about alleviating the conditions that drive Central Americans northward.\n\nYet, the fraught debate over the border illustrates why Harris\u2019 most high-profile solo assignment is so challenging.\n\n\u2014 House Republicans led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy voted to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from her role as the No. 3 GOP leader in the House over her criticism of former President Trump.\n\n\u2014 Two former Trump administration officials faced tough questions at a congressional hearing on their roles in the sharply criticized response to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.\n\n\u2014 California Republican gubernatorial candidate Kevin Faulconer unveiled a tax plan that would eliminate state income tax for individuals who make less than $50,000 and families that earn less than $100,000.\n\n\u2014 An independent redistricting commission that California voters created to stop lawmakers and powerful interests from drawing gerrymandered congressional and legislative districts is now accused of routinely flouting the law with acts that threaten to undermine its impartiality.\n\nFor more news and analysis, sign up for our Essential Politics newsletter, sent to your inbox three days a week.\n\nAn End to Mandatory Masks Soon?\n\nNewsom said that California could significantly ease its mask mandates in the coming weeks as coronavirus cases continue to decline and vaccinations increase.\n\nState health officials have not offered guidance, but Newsom said it could come soon. On June 15, when the state is slated to reopen its economy, \u201cwe\u2019ll move beyond the blueprint and we\u2019ll be in a completely different space,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe will be updating our mask guidelines, outdoor masking, if we reach that threshold where we hope to be\u2026. In fact, it will be eliminated, those mandates. They\u2019ll be guidelines or recommendations.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s comment comes amid growing debate about how much longer mask mandates should remain as the country \u2014 and California especially \u2014 recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u2014 Children as young as 12 should get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a government advisory panel says. The recommendation means middle school and high school students could be vaccinated before the next school year starts.\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s a simple enough concept, but so-called vaccine passports have become a loaded topic in corners of the U.S. where distrust of government runs high, sparking new conspiracy theories, wild social media claims and protests.\n\n\u2014 As California gains the upper hand on COVID-19, who is still dying? An average of 57 Californians a day succumb to the virus.\n\n\u2014 Enlarged lymph nodes are a sign COVID-19 vaccines are working. But as vaccinated people flock back to mammography clinics, the side effects of the shots are showing up as false red flags for breast cancer.\n\nOn the Streets in Bogot\u00e1\n\nColombia has become a nation gripped by protests.\n\nThey began two weeks ago in reaction to a government tax-increase plan that opponents said would disproportionately hurt low-income Colombians, who already suffering amid the pandemic. But the demonstrations quickly morphed into broader calls for improved healthcare, education, security and other demands.\n\nHundreds of thousands of students, teachers, trade union members, farmers, Indigenous activists and others are now taking to the streets each day. The mass mobilizations have largely shut down cities and left dozens dead \u2014 most killed by police, according to human rights groups. One slain activist has become a symbol of resistance.\n\nAnd they could be a sign of things to come in Latin America, where the pandemic and its fallout have exacerbated long-standing inequities.\n\nIt\u2019s not your imagination: The price of a lot of things is going up.\n\nThe return of inflation has been reflected in the cost of food at the grocery store, computers, shoes, furniture, sporting equipment and many more goods and services. Used car and truck prices jumped 10% between March and April; airfares and hotel rates rose about as much.\n\nThe big question now is whether the current price surges are temporary or are warning signs of serious problems ahead.\n\nHere\u2019s why most economists agree that inflation worries, at least for now, are overdone.\n\nIn 1971, Chicano rights demonstrators undertook a long walk from Calexico to Sacramento to draw attention to their cause. The group began May 5, and by May 12, about 25 marchers had reached the Salton Sea, where The Times caught up with them.\n\nThey said some who encountered the group offered praise or food and shelter. On other occasions, drivers shouted \u201cracist catcalls\u201d and big rigs \u201croared close enough to the highway shoulder to nearly blow the marchers down,\u201d The Times reported. The marchers reached Sacramento in August, and about 200 Chicano demonstrators held a 20-minute protest on the front lawn of Gov. Ronald Reagan\u2019s home.\n\n\u2014 State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta will create a racial justice bureau to combat white supremacy and biased policing as well as to explore the possibility of reparations for slavery.\n\n\u2014 The Jesuit priest who oversaw Biden\u2019s inaugural Mass has resigned from his post as president of Santa Clara University after an internal investigation found he engaged in behaviors that conflicted with the Jesuit order\u2019s \u201cprotocols and boundaries,\u201d according to a school statement.\n\n\u2014 Low attendance among middle and high school students in the reopened Los Angeles Unified School District have education officials fretting over what these figures portend for next fall.\n\n\u2014 An Australian destroyer pulled into San Diego Bay last weekend with two dead fin whales lodged against the ship\u2019s hull.\n\n\u2014 Criticized for its slow response to escalating warfare, the Biden administration plunged into urgent diplomacy, dispatching an emergency envoy to the Mideast, appealing directly to Israel\u2019s prime minister and insisting Israelis and Palestinians deserve \u201cequal measures\u201d of security and freedom.\n\n\u2014 A Minnesota judge has ruled that there were aggravating factors in the death of George Floyd, paving the way for a longer sentence for former Police Officer Derek Chauvin, according to an order.\n\n\u2014 Independent experts who reviewed the World Health Organization\u2019s pandemic response say the agency should be granted \u201cguaranteed rights of access\u201d in countries to investigate emerging outbreaks \u2014 a contentious idea that would give it more powers and require member states to give up some of theirs.\n\n\u2014 Ellen DeGeneres will end her daytime talk show next year after more than 4,400 episodes. The show faced allegations of a toxic work environment.\n\n\u2014 Foo Fighters, the Go-Go\u2019s, Jay-Z, Carole King, Todd Rundgren and Tina Turner will join the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this year as part of the latest class of inductees.\n\n\u2014 HBO\u2019s \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d is airing on an old-fashioned one-episode-a-week timeline.

Our pop music critic ranked all 31 of them.\n\n\u2014 The U.S. lumber market is out of control, with prices skyrocketing due to low borrowing rates, growing appetites for bigger homes and a frenzy of DIY pandemic renovations.\n\n\u2014 Gasoline prices are jumping and shortages are expanding in Southeastern states in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack. Gas prices are up in California too, but for totally different reasons \u2014 in fact, inventory is above normal for the West.\n\n\u2014 The Rams will start their season Sept. 12 against the Chicago Bears at home at SoFi Stadium, which barring a COVID-19-related setback is on track to host fans for games for the first time. Here\u2019s more from the team\u2019s just-released schedule.\n\n\u2014 Kobe Bryant was not just an American icon.

            "description": "Lithium Mining Projects May Not Be Green Friendly  The New York Times",
            "content": "The Salton Sea is one of numerous new mining proposals in a global gold rush to find new sources of metals and minerals needed for electric cars and renewable energy.Credit...\n\nA race is on to produce lithium in the United States, but competing projects are taking very different approaches to extracting the vital raw material. Some might not be very green.\n\nThe Salton Sea is one of numerous new mining proposals in a global gold rush to find new sources of metals and minerals needed for electric cars and renewable energy.\n\nAtop a long-dormant volcano in northern Nevada, workers are preparing to start blasting and digging out a giant pit that will serve as the first new large-scale lithium mine in the United States in more than a decade \u2014 a new domestic supply of an essential ingredient in electric car batteries and renewable energy. The mine, constructed on leased federal lands, could help address the near total reliance by the United States on foreign sources of lithium. But the project, known as Lithium Americas, has drawn protests from members of a Native American tribe, ranchers and environmental groups because it is expected to use billions of gallons of precious ground water, potentially contaminating some of it for 300 years, while leaving behind a giant mound of waste. \u201cBlowing up a mountain isn\u2019t green, no matter how much marketing spin people put on it,\u201d said Max Wilbert, who has been living in a tent on the proposed mine site while two lawsuits seeking to block the project wend their way through federal courts.\n\nThe fight over the Nevada mine is emblematic of a fundamental tension surfacing around the world: Electric cars and renewable energy may not be as green as they appear. Production of raw materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel that are essential to these technologies are often ruinous to land, water, wildlife and people. That environmental toll has often been overlooked in part because there is a race underway among the United States, China, Europe and other major powers. Echoing past contests and wars over gold and oil, governments are fighting for supremacy over minerals that could help countries achieve economic and technological dominance for decades to come. Developers and lawmakers see this Nevada project, given final approval in the last days of the Trump administration, as part of the opportunity for the United States to become a leader in producing some of these raw materials as President Biden moves aggressively to fight climate change. In addition to Nevada, businesses have proposed lithium production sites in California, Oregon, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina. But traditional mining is one of the dirtiest businesses out there. That reality is not lost on automakers and renewable-energy businesses. \u201cOur new clean-energy demands could be creating greater harm, even though its intention is to do good,\u201d said Aimee Boulanger, executive director for the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, a group that vets mines for companies like BMW and Ford Motor. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina just put out its next five-year plan,\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said in a recent interview. \u201cThey want to be the go-to place for the guts of the batteries, yet we have these minerals in the United States. We have not taken advantage of them, to mine them.\u201d In March, she announced grants to increase production of crucial minerals. \u201cThis is a race to the future that America is going to win,\u201d she said. So far, the Biden administration has not moved to help push more environmentally friendly options \u2014 like lithium brine extraction, instead of open pit mines. The Interior Department declined to say whether it would shift its stand on the Lithium Americas permit, which it is defending in court. Mining companies and related businesses want to accelerate domestic production of lithium and are pressing the administration and key lawmakers to insert a $10 billion grant program into Mr. Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill, arguing that it is a matter of national security. \u201cRight now, if China decided to cut off the U.S. for a variety of reasons we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Ben Steinberg, an Obama administration official turned lobbyist. He was hired in January by \u200bPiedmont Lithium, which is working to build an open-pit mine in North Carolina and is one of several companies that have created a trade association for the industry. Investors are rushing to get permits for new mines and begin production to secure contracts with battery companies and automakers. Ultimately, federal and state officials will decide which of the two methods \u2014 traditional mining or brine extraction \u2014 is approved. Both could take hold. Much will depend on how successful environmentalists, tribes and local groups are in blocking projects.\n\n\u201cIt is real frustrating that it is being pitched as an environmentally friendly project, when it is really a huge industrial site,\u201d said Mr. Bartell, who filed a lawsuit to try to block the mine. At the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, anger over the project has boiled over, even causing some fights between members as Lithium Americas has offered to hire tribal members in jobs that will pay an average annual wage of $62,675 \u2014 twice the county\u2019s per capita income \u2014 but that will come with a big trade-off. \u201cTell me, what water am I going to drink for 300 years?\u201d Deland Hinkey, a member of the tribe, yelled as a federal official arrived at the reservation in March to brief tribal leaders on the mining plan. \u201cAnybody, answer my question. After you contaminate my water, what I am going to drink for 300 years? You are lying!\u201d The reservation is nearly 50 miles from the mine site \u2014 and far beyond the area where groundwater may be contaminated \u2014 but tribe members fear the pollution could spread.\n\nBut a new wave of investors is promoting the lake as one of the most promising and environmentally friendly lithium prospects in the United States. Lithium extraction from brine has long been used in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina, where the sun is used over nearly two years to evaporate water from sprawling ponds. It is relatively inexpensive, but it uses lots of water in arid areas. The approach planned at the Salton Sea is radically different from the one traditionally used in South America. The lake sits atop the Salton Buttes, which, as in Nevada, are underground volcanoes. For years, a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, CalEnergy, and another business, Energy Source, have tapped the Buttes\u2019 geothermal heat to produce electricity. The systems use naturally occurring underground steam. This same water is loaded with lithium. Now, Berkshire Hathaway and two other companies \u2014 Controlled Thermal Resources and Materials Research \u2014 want to install equipment that will extract lithium after the water passes through the geothermal plants, in a process that will take only about two hours. Rod Colwell, a burly Australian, has spent much of the last decade pitching investors and lawmakers on putting the brine to use. In February, a backhoe plowed dirt on a 7,000-acre site being developed by his company, Controlled Thermal Resources. \u201cThis is the sweet spot,\u201d Mr. Colwell said. \u201cThis is the most sustainable lithium in the world, made in America. Who would have thought it? We\u2019ve got this massive opportunity.\u201d\n\nA Berkshire Hathaway executive told state officials recently that the company expected to complete its demonstration plant for lithium extraction by April 2022. The backers of the Salton Sea lithium projects are also working with local groups and hope to offer good jobs in an area that has an unemployment rate of nearly 16 percent. \u201cOur region is very rich in natural resources and mineral resources,\u201d said Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, which represents area farm workers. \u201cHowever, they\u2019re very poorly distributed. The population has not been afforded a seat at the table.\u201d The state has given millions in grants to lithium extraction companies, and the Legislature is considering requiring carmakers by 2035 to use California sources for some of the lithium in vehicles they sell in the state, the country\u2019s largest electric-car market. But even these projects have raised some questions. Geothermal plants produce energy without emissions, but they can require tens of billions of gallons of water annually for cooling. And lithium extraction from brine dredges up minerals like iron and salt that need to be removed before the brine is injected back into the ground. Similar extraction efforts at the Salton Sea have previously failed. In 2000, CalEnergy proposed spending $200 million to extract zinc and to help restore the Salton Sea. The company gave up on the effort in 2004.\n\nBut several companies working on the direct lithium extraction technique \u2014 including Lilac Solutions, based in California, and Standard Lithium of Vancouver, British Columbia \u2014 are confident they have mastered the technology. Both companies have opened demonstration projects using the brine extraction technology, with Standard Lithium tapping into a brine source already being extracted from the ground by an Arkansas chemical plant, meaning it did not need to take additional water from the ground. \u201cThis green aspect is incredibly important,\u201d said Robert Mintak, chief executive of Standard Lithium, who hopes the company will produce 21,000 tons a year of lithium in Arkansas within five years if it can raise $440 million in financing. \u201cThe Fred Flintstone approach is not the solution to the lithium challenge.\u201d Lilac Solutions, whose clients include Controlled Thermal Resources, is also working on direct lithium extraction in Nevada, North Dakota and at least one other U.S. location that it would not disclose. The company predicts that within five years, these projects could produce about 100,000 tons of lithium annually, or 20 times current domestic production. Executives from companies like Lithium Americas question if these more innovative approaches can deliver all the lithium the world needs. But automakers are keen to pursue approaches that have a much smaller impact on the environment. \u201cIndigenous tribes being pushed out or their water being poisoned or any of those types of issues, we just don\u2019t want to be party to that,\u201d said Sue Slaughter, Ford\u2019s purchasing director for supply chain sustainability. \u201cWe really want to force the industries that we\u2019re buying materials from to make sure that they\u2019re doing it in a responsible way. As an industry, we are going to be buying so much of these materials that we do have significant power to leverage that situation very strongly. And we intend to do that.\u201d",

The reservation is nearly 50 miles from the mine site \u2014 and far beyond the area where groundwater may be contaminated \u2014 but tribe members fear the pollution could spread.\n\nBut a new wave of investors is promoting the lake as one of the most promising and environmentally friendly lithium prospects in the United States. A Berkshire Hathaway executive told state officials recently that the company expected to complete its demonstration plant for lithium extraction by April 2022. The state has given millions in grants to lithium extraction companies, and the Legislature is considering requiring carmakers by 2035 to use California sources for some of the lithium in vehicles they sell in the state, the country\u2019s largest electric-car market.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWe introduce you to Sabrina Tavernise, one of our guest hosts. Plus, our annual summer playlist.\n\nAs you might have heard on the show, Michael Barbaro and his wife recently had a baby. Over the next few months, Michael won\u2019t be working every day, giving you the chance to hear from a broader set of voices on the show. Recently, we introduced you to guest host Astead Herndon. Today, you\u2019ll get to meet another one: Sabrina Tavernise, a national correspondent. Then, read on for The Daily\u2019s 2021 summer playlist. If you\u2019ve got a song that you\u2019ve been grooving to this summer, send it to us at thedaily@nytimes.com.\n\nMichael Barbaro: So Sabrina, this is all about you, so let me start with a big ol\u2019 Daily-style inquiry. Where does the Sabrina Tavernise journalism story start? Don\u2019t hold back. I really do mean the beginning. Sabrina Tavernise: Oh wow. Didn\u2019t realize this was the idea. Michael: Oh yes. We are going there. So, where did you grow up? Sabrina: A tiny rural community in western Mass., called Granville. It has lots of apples and votes Republican; 1,800 people. Sabrina: Yes, too small for a high school. And it is still shrinking. They just closed the primary school, because there aren\u2019t enough kids. It\u2019s beautiful though. Michael: It literally sounds like the kind of place Sabrina Tavernise writes about today. Changing. Shrinking. Uncomfortably.\n\nSabrina: Yes, in a way, yes. Michael: GRANVILLE, MASS. \u2014 I write about these kind of towns all the time. Michael: So what came next? Sabrina: I had studied Russian in college. I wanted to go to Russia. I sent my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to dozens of places in Moscow. None took me. I called the National Audubon Society in Alaska and someone named Bucky told me there was an opening for a translator going to a nature preserve near Magadan. Michael: Magadan, Russia, that is. (I had to Google that). Well, wow. Thanks, Bucky! Sabrina: I spent two months on an uninhabited piece of land strewn with rusty barrels of oil with like 30 high school kids and a few educators. On my way back to Anchorage at the end of the summer, I met someone who was leaving a U.S.A.I.D. funded job in Magadan. A kind of school that taught Russians about capitalism. I worked there for two years. My Russian got really good. I sometimes went on a radio program out there. Then in 1997, I moved to Moscow. I had no plans. But I had great Russian. I made a list of the things I liked to do and was good at, and didn\u2019t like to do and was bad at. Basically journalism came out on top because I had this instinct to write home about everything that I was seeing. And trying to convey the wonder and the sense of the absurd in everyday Russia. It was the same instinct for being a foreign correspondent. Michael: So, why Russian language and why Russia, of all places? Sabrina: Complete accident. I had to take a language requirement. The wall was falling. I chose Russian. I loved the challenge of trying to figure out: Where is this country headed, based on its distant past (I was reading its history), its current events (I would soon be covering them)? Michael: What kept you there and drew you in? Sabrina: It sounds cheesy, but it is true: The people. Russia is such a weird place. Dark in so many ways, but also utterly fun-loving and throws caution to the wind. Every day might be your last, so let\u2019s spend everything right now and have a really good time. A disaster, but a really charming one.\n\nIt was also the place I grew up \u2014 spent most of my 20s. Owned my first car. Had my first car stolen! Met my husband. So once you find yourself in Russia, having mastered the language and deciding that journalism is the best way to communicate everything you\u2019re experiencing and observing, how did you go about finding a reporting gig? What was your big breakthrough in the field? Sabrina: I applied all over and didn\u2019t get hired. But there was this new news agency called Bloomberg News. They had one guy in a conference room in a hotel in Moscow called the Olympic Penta. He gave me a short writing test and then basically hired me on the spot. So then it was just me and him working in that conference room. Competing with Reuters staff of 50-60. I remember at the time no one knew what Bloomberg News was. I stood up at a press conference and asked the prime minister, Chernomyrdin, a question, and he told me to identify myself. Then he was like, \u201cLook, I know your name is Bloomberg, but what damned agency are you from?\u201d Michael: It\u2019s amazing to think that there was a time when Bloomberg News was a young, struggling upstart. Sabrina: Yes. In Russia, it was totally new. They later hired a bunch of people and got a fancy office. But it started small! I worked there for about 2 years \u2014 through a financial crisis, which was really, really hard. Then, The Times was trying to supplement its international business coverage, so it hired stringers in a few places \u2014 Moscow, Rio, London, Shanghai. I became the Moscow one.\n\nMy first big story was the sinking of the Kursk submarine \u2014 all of these sailors knocking desperate morse code messages as it sank. Everybody died. Michael: I remember it well. It was a horrible tragedy. I\u2019m also curious how and why you ended up in Iraq. If my memory serves me, you spent time there covering the war. That feels like a big scary decision. Sabrina: Yes good memory! I went to Iraq at the tail end of the invasion \u2014 basically as the looting was finishing in the spring of 2003. It was the first time I\u2019d covered anything outside Russia. It was very new for me. And it was the first time I\u2019d ever been in a war. Journalistically, it was hard; I didn\u2019t speak Arabic. I eventually found a translator I really bonded with and we spent most of the war together. She was a divorced mother of two from a secular Shiite family. I remember we would go to the main Baghdad morgue every month to get their numbers for body counts. And as the war ramped up, the statistics kept going up and up and up \u2014 1,000 a month, then 2,000 and then 3,000. All these bodies from different cleansings in different parts of the city. It was like watching a society split apart \u2014 and America had set it all into motion. Michael: So, once again, you are covering fatalism and tragedy. And all of that lays the groundwork for the Modern Sabrina, who returns to the U.S. and spends years translating this country to Times listeners, telling remarkable stories about unforgettable characters (Abraham Davis) and deep-seated conflicts (abortion) as a national correspondent and, lately, translating the dense but important world of demography \u2014 unlocking the data that tells us who we are, what we are up to, what we want, our divisions, our inequities. Basically, whether we are living up to our expectations for ourselves. And it\u2019s in this role that Daily listeners really meet you \u2014 and love you.\n\nSabrina: Thank you! It was a hard transition from being abroad, but one I eventually managed. Michael: I feel your bio perfectly set you up for this moment when we asked you to help host the show, because you\u2019ve covered such big and rich and varied subjects around the globe. What\u2019s the transition been like from reporter/Daily guest to having hosting responsibilities? Sabrina: Hard! I love audio. Definitely my favorite medium. But I\u2019m not used to actually creating it. So there\u2019s a learning curve. But I love it. I still feel like that cartoon T-rex trying. Like I have these really powerful legs from running but I\u2019m being told that the one thing I need to do now is pull-ups and so I\u2019m trying to do pull-ups with these little, undeveloped arms. And no one cares how fast I can run. Sabrina: Hard! Yeah. It is weird. but great! Michael: When I think of the history of the show, I think of so many episodes we made with you that felt like watershed moments for The Daily. Especially the two-part history of Roe v. Wade. It was as if we\u2019d all walked around for years thinking we knew what that case was really about, and then you told us a story that made clear we didn\u2019t. So Sabrina, I\u2019ve now kept you for 45 minutes (!) Any final thoughts? On The Daily? Hosting? The heat? We have to find a way to cover this heat in New York on the show. Sabrina: Hahahaha. Final thoughts: I love the show. I feel honored to be part of it. Talk to Sabrina and Michael on Twitter: @stavernise and @mikiebarb.\n\nWe\u2019re officially midway through the summer. It\u2019s been a hot and sticky one, but many are feeling jazzed up like it\u2019s 2019 again, releasing pent-up energy after more than a year in lockdown (cue \u201cHot Girl Summer\u201d). Music has been a refuge for our team throughout the pandemic, so we were excited to put together this year\u2019s summer playlist. You can follow the full playlist on Spotify, and below is a taste of what you\u2019ll find. (Though some tracks are best for adult ears only.)\n\u2022 None \u201cLiz\u201d by Remi Wolf: \u201cThis song is so fun and soulful, with an irresistible dash of funk grooves to make you move. I love attempting Remi\u2019s vocal runs and riffs on this song. My neighbors probably don\u2019t, though.\u201d \u2014 Sydney Harper, a producer\n\u2022 None \u201cCaribbean\u201d by Astro: \u201cI miss Astro. The group spent a few years making super fun synth tracks about rabbits and dolphins and druids and then they peaced out. They lived in a world of eternal sunshine and summer, and I wish they would come back.\u201d \u2014 Michael Simon Johnson, a producer\n\u2022 None \u201cGoosebumps\u201d by Travis Scott (featuring Kendrick Lamar): \u201cThis is my 1-year-old daughter\u2019s number one. She can\u2019t stop herself when it comes on Hot 97; she has to move.\u201d \u2014 Paige Cowett, an editor\n\u2022 None \u201cBodies (Intro)\u201d by Jazmine Sullivan: \u201cI\u2019m suggesting the first song on Jazmine\u2019s album \u201cHeaux Tales,\u201d but every track on the record is both a banger and a short story.

            "content": "While diversity, equity and inclusion are paramount to attracting and retaining top talent, many companies miss the mark. When brands do implement a program, it may not actually be effective. \u201cFor so long, we looked up at largely white men and asked them how the organization is doing on diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d Michael Munoz, who leads diversity, equity and inclusion within Marketing at Google, tells We First. \u201cWe need to look at the Black, Latinx, Asian, indigenous populations and ask, \u2018How are we doing at building a culture where you feel empowered and a strong sense of psychological safety?\u2019\u201d\n\nPerformance Paradigm is helping Google do just that. The company has been advising top business leaders for nearly 30 years about how to shift the conversation around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) to create more deeply engaged leaders and teams. \u201cA lot of senior leadership is afraid of messing up. I don't care if you mess up. If you're trying, at least you\u2019re showing evidence of effort. That will make your team stay. We need people to get involved and stay engaged.\u201d Reggie Butler, founder of Performance Paradigm, says.\n\nGoogle has contracted Performance Paradigm to develop their own diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Examined Human and Digital Human (alongside creative technology company Left Field Labs, a partner on the project). Through shared experiences and community building, the partnership is a disruptive way to truly incorporate DEI within Google. The collaboration between Performance Paradigm and Google offers actionable insights for executives looking to Lead With We.\n\nWhy companies get diversity, equity and inclusion wrong\n\nDespite the best of intentions, many DEI programs haven\u2019t produced long lasting change. \u201cSomebody will look at their organization and say, \u2018We have a representation issue.\u2019 They try to solve for representation. However, they don't solve the environmental issues that create exclusion,\u201d Butler says. \u201cPeople don't feel like they belong. People have very different lived experiences. The bigger issue is more complex than representation. So, sometimes it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s much progress in organizational programs. They\u2019re only looking at certain indicators.\u201d Essentially, many leaders aren\u2019t considering the whole picture. They must understand and highlight new perspectives to start deconstructing old habits.\n\nIt takes leadership with an active desire and understanding to change complex issues around race, sexual orientation, and unconscious bias. The partnership between Google and Performance Paradigm started with Reggie and Michael\u2019s shared desire to disrupt the status quo.\n\n\u201cI was tired of looking at data that said people from different genders and races were having different experiences. To fix that, we needed to change the way that their managers and leaders were thinking about them in the organization. That is the beginning of changing behaviors,\u201d Munoz says.\n\nWhen the two met, they both wanted to implement a program that would be so transformative that staff members and leadership couldn\u2019t go back to their desks and forget about it.\n\n\u201cIt all started with someone trying to solve a human-centered problem. They need different people to actually be a part of that solution,\u201d Butler adds.\n\nA collective love for art and music as well as the belief that shared experience can be a transformational tool to create community, brought the two thought leaders together. Those shared values sprouted the formation of new DEI models.\n\n\u201cExamined Human is the first thing we built together. We've created a bunch of shared experiences that Covid-19 made Digital Human necessary for us to do. We migrated a lot of that content, methodology and learnings about creating shared experience into a digital platform,\u201d Munoz says.\n\nDigital Human helps leadership and team members navigate DEI. The program concentrates on four key behaviors, Munoz describes.\n\u2022 Show up: \u201cHave you shown up for your stakeholders in meaningful ways when it matters most?\u201d\n\u2022 Be present: \u201cUnderstand the issues at hand for individuals who might look different or have different lived experiences than you.\u201d\n\u2022 Create visibility: \u201cAre you, as a leader, able to create visibility that is in service of the people on your team?\u201d\n\u2022 Proximate: \u201cDo you know where your folks want to go? Do you know your users well enough to be able to amplify voices in the direction they want to go, whether they're in the room or not?\u201d\n\nBiases can be deeply rooted. It takes real work to break them down. \u201cOur leaders need to unlearn,\u201d Munoz says. Unlearning is a powerful concept. Executives often have to face difficult questions that might bring up uncomfortable feelings. \u201cWhen executives ask, \u2018How can I do more?\u2019 I often ask them \u2018When did you realize you were white and it mattered? How are you using your position to deliver access and privilege to others?\u2019\u201d Butler shares. \u201cThose questions are presented to them through an experience. So they can\u2019t unsee it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the engagement activities we do is called \u20182, 24, 25.\u2019 You pick two people on your team, one that you know fairly well and one that you barely know. Within 24 hours, schedule a 25-minute meeting with them and talk about them. Don't talk about a project,\u201d Butler explains. \u201cThe feedback we get sounds like, \u2018It was pretty easy to start the conversation with the person I knew. When I went to the person I didn't know, they thought something was wrong. It was awkward but a great exercise.\u2019 It highlights that you're supposed to create belonging for all, not belonging for people in your prototype.\u201d\n\nTo create that sense of belonging, the Digital Human platform includes 12 weeks of workshops and exercises. The content is structured like a four season show. \u201cWe still used art and all the experiential things to deliver it, but we wouldn't let them fast forward. We wouldn't let them binge, they had to stop and do the work,\u201d Butler says.\n\nFor senior leadership, 12 weeks of diversity and inclusion training might sound like a diversion from hitting project deadlines and sales targets.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u2018Why is diversity important?\u2019\u201d Munoz says. \u201cThe answer is, it's not. It's not important unless you build a culture of inclusion. If you have an organization with a lot of diversity and no psychological safety, that company either has or will soon have a retention problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe took a lot of heat when we decided to go for it,\u201d he continues. \u201cPeople said, \u2018I only have three hours. Let me just binge through this.\u2019 What's been incredible is that now folks are emailing me to say, \u2018It's my Friday night appointment viewing.\u2019 It helps them frame how they want to show up the next week or in the next one-on-one differently.\u201d\n\nBy measuring results based on feedback from underrepresented employees, Google is getting a better sense of the long lasting benefits. \u201cTeam members will ping me and say, \u2018I'm going to stay here longer because my relationship with my manager has gotten better. I don't know what you did to them when they went through the training but they\u2019re showing up for me differently. I feel like I have a voice. I have better psychological safety.\u2019,\u201d Michael explains.\n\n\u201cWe've got to move a person from being transactional about their job and the people that help to get the job done, to being transformative and human-centered,\u201d Butler says. \u201cWhen people come out of the training, they're more focused on their humans than they are on the project.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the long-term benefits of building culture and retaining talent pay off when it comes to DEI training like Digital Human and Examined Human. \u201cAre you able to retain the talent that you have and acquire new, diverse, underrepresented talent moving forward? that's going to be the new barometer for us,\u201d Munoz says.\n\nWhen you're trying to be at service to everyone inside your organization, there can be sensitivity amongst those who have enjoyed privileges. They may feel like they\u2019ve done something wrong. At the same time, there can be uncomfortable feelings around favoring those who have been marginalized in different ways in the past and trying to better serve them. How can a company resolve that?\n\n\u201cWe started both programs with the premise that human connection will define our future,\u201d Munoz says. \u201cWe're creators of a just Google that elevates the power of people through equitable systems, continuous learning and collective action. When you center everything on this operating premise, it frees people up. It brings us to focus on the common good and collective action. There can also be a paralysis, especially for white males in leadership positions. They don\u2019t want to say anything wrong or be perceived as out of touch, so they don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nAnother core concept of the training is the idea of \u201ccalling in.\u201d \u201cWe think everyone needs to find their voice and be vulnerable,\u201d Munoz says. \u201cThe Digital Human or Examined Human programs help folks understand that there is a place for everyone in the conversation but doing nothing is not an option.\u201d\n\nWhen the focus goes astray, Munoz and Butler use methods like art, music and frameworks to bring the focus back towards the common goal. \u201cWe try to create shared experiences through storytelling and narratives, but also some shared accountability,\u201d Butler says. \u201cHere\u2019s an example. We were talking about how people who are Black, Latinx and women, have a very different experience than white males. We take them through a small exercise. Some of them say, \u2018That's never happened to me. So I don't believe it's true.\u2019 Somebody else in the room goes, \u2018It happens every day. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean we're not supposed to do something.\u2019 By having collective experiences, Reggie and Michael hope participants from all backgrounds will feel a deeper sense of belonging at work.\n\nPerformance Paradigm utilizes what Reggie calls R.I.C.H. Dialogues to facilitate authentic communication and community building. \u201cR.I.C.H. is an acronym for race, identity, culture, and heritage,\u201d he says. \u2018It's a type of communication tool that accelerates relationship management by exploring all the different points of view around race, identity, culture, and heritage.\u201d\n\nBehavior change, whether it's around DEI, marketing or even taking a different route to work, is extremely difficult to catalyze. \u201cIt starts with people saying, \u2018I know what the problem is. I may not know what to do, but I must listen.\u2019 If we can get people to use a tool to help them frame these conversations that typically paralyze them, we're going to make incremental progress,\u201d Butler says.\n\nWhile unlearning and increased awareness often happens after a DEI training, it can be difficult to maintain and measure the long lasting impacts. Some of the ways Digital Human and Examined Human try to prolong the lessons is by providing participants with memorabilia like bracelets and art, as well as building real relationships with coworkers and employees on a human-to-human level.\n\n\u201cIt's an opportunity to rejigger people\u2019s mindsets to catalyze the experience in the course so they show up a little differently for their one-on-one meetings,\u201d Munoz says. By implementing leadership buy-in, measuring the success by feedback from underrepresented groups and taking a more human approach, the impacts of diversity, equity and inclusion can be sustained over time.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that diverse teams are more resilient, more creative and more effective at generating results. \u201cTalk about diversity and innovation. Imagine when everybody's working well together.\u201d Munoz says. \u201cThat's that magic sauce that is going to unlock the creativity we've talked about for years.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to dive deeper with more purpose-led companies like Performance Paradigm and Google, check out the Lead with We podcast here, so that you too can build a company that transforms consumer behavior and our future.",

            "description": "Should We Try to Make Contact With Aliens?  The New York Times",
            "content": "In June, the Pentagon released a much anticipated report on, quote, \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d or what you and I might call U.F.O.s. They looked at scores of reports of unknown sightings and found 18 cases that might have shown technology beyond what our enemies, and ourselves for that matter, are capable of. So the government finally admitted that there really are unidentified flying objects in our skies, moving in ways they can\u2019t explain. So does that mean aliens? I\u2019m Jane Coaston. And sometimes I come to a debate from a point of view of a blank slate. Anyone could convince me. But I feel like I should be upfront with you here. I do not like thinking about aliens. Just watching Sigourney Weaver wake up out of her sleeping pod in \u201cAlien\u201d was enough to chase me out of the room. But it does feel like we\u2019ve all been thrust into this new paradigm shift. U.F.O.s are real, and the government admitted it. And reality didn\u2019t break. Hysteria hasn\u2019t broken out. In fact, you may have heard the news with a \u201chuh,\u201d or \u201cthat checks out.\u201d Whether or not we assume these flying objects that move in a way we don\u2019t understand are evidence of extraterrestrial life, experts say we\u2019re closer than ever to finding possible life outside of our solar system, which leaves us with a big question. Should we try to make contact with possible life on other planets? Should we beam out stronger signals to potential alien life forms to let them know we\u2019re here and we want to communicate? It turns out my guests today could not disagree more on the answer. Dr. Douglas Vakoch is the president and founder of METI, which stands for Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It\u2019s a nonprofit research and educational organization dedicated to transmitting intentional signals to nearby stars. Arguing against reaching out is Dr. Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York. He co-founded string field theory and has been very vocal about the dangers of reaching out to E.T. Dr. Kaku, what were your thoughts on the report?\n\nI think the idea of reaching out and advertising our existence is a catastrophically bad idea. In fact, I think it would be the biggest mistake in human history to deliberately try to make contact with an adversary that we know nothing about. The collapse of civilization as we know it could happen for five reasons. The first reason \u2014 history has shown that civilizations have unequal technological rank, when they collide, have catastrophic implications. When Montezuma of the Aztecs met Cortez of the Spanish empire, Montezuma made the biggest mistake in all of ancient history. He assumed that Cortez was a god. But what did Cortez have? He had gunpowder, steel weapons, not bronze, horses. And within a matter of years, this proud civilization collapsed. Second of all, when you negotiate with an adversary, the first thing you want to know is, what do they have, and what do they want? It\u2019s naive to try to reach out and say, here we are, without understanding the level of technology of the aliens and what they want. In \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d the aliens wanted the Earth. Mars was dying. They needed a lush planet to colonize. We were in the way. In \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d the aliens were like locusts, devouring every single scrap of energy and resources available to them. The Borg from \u201cStar Trek,\u201d resistance is futile because they would absorb you. What did they want? Our mind. So in other words, we have to understand what do they want. Number three, this could be revolution in action on a cosmic scale, survival of the fittest. When animals bump into other animals, it\u2019s the law of the tooth and fang. Number four, some people think we already broadcast \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d so what\u2019s the big deal? The big deal is we\u2019re still in the early stages of radio telescope technology. Perhaps there are only 29 \u2014 at last count \u2014 29 planets that are habitable within the range of \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d and \u201cLeave it to Beaver.\u201d That\u2019s why I think that there\u2019s still time, still time to stop broadcasting our position to the aliens in outer space. And point number five, what would it be from their perspective? If you\u2019re walking down a forest road, and you see a bunch of ants, do you go down to the ants and say, I bring you trinkets. I bring you beads. I give you nuclear energy. Take me to your ant queen. Or do you have this strange politically incorrect urge to step on a few of them? If they can visit us, they are perhaps hundreds of thousands to millions of years more advanced than us. So the point I\u2019m raising is, it\u2019s naive to assume that they\u2019re peaceful, that they want to give us the benefit of their technology, when they could be like Cortez.\n\nWell, sure, Michio raises a number of points that really pull at our primordial response to this possibility of aliens. So let me address a few of the five points that he mentioned. First of all, history is something we go to. We haven\u2019t contacted aliens, so we look for an analog. And this is one of the visions that we have of an alien invasion. It\u2019s as when Cortez from Spain went to the Aztecs and overtook their empire. But the problem with that analogy is that it wasn\u2019t Montezuma who needed to say, come here. Cortez didn\u2019t seek their permission. He wasn\u2019t waiting for some invitation across the sea before he went there. He went for the gold. And so, in the same way, if there is an advanced civilization, such as Michio talks about, they could already be coming here. If, in fact, they\u2019re on their way, it\u2019s to our advantage to let them know we make interesting conversational partners. But he talks, too, about the images we get from movies. Those images from Hollywood tap into one of our cognitive biases called the availability heuristic. When we\u2019re trying to assess some unknown risk, we tap into the most vivid images. And that\u2019s what we base our judgment on. I mean, what could be more vivid than an \u201cIndependence Day\u201d invasion, the Europeans going to the new world and decimating the indigenous peoples? But that doesn\u2019t mean that those are realistic. And I agree with Michio when he says that so far, of the exoplanets that we know of, only about 29 have gotten our incidental leakage radiation because that\u2019s traveling at the speed of light. And we have had radio signals for about 100 years. They travel outward continuously. But the critical issue is we cannot take those back. So because those radio waves are going in a sphere around Earth every year, they\u2019re passing by more and more stars. So we have already let ourselves be known. The big question is whether we want to follow that up with an indication that we want to make contact to say, yes, we assume you already know we\u2019re here. And now we want to engage in a conversation. Some people would say, well, wait if they already know we\u2019re here, what\u2019s the whole point of reaching out? We\u2019re trying to test what\u2019s called the zoo hypothesis as a hypothesis for why we haven\u2019t yet made contact if, in fact, they\u2019re out there. Well, maybe it\u2019s as if they are looking at us like we are animals in the zoo. Imagine, Jane, Michio, all three of us go to the Bronx Zoo, and, you know, we\u2019re kind of checking out the animals. We know that they\u2019re there already. We\u2019re walking by a bunch of zebras. And one of them turns toward us, looks us directly in the eye, and starts pounding out a series of prime numbers with his hoof. Now I don\u2019t know. Maybe Jane, Michio, you guys are going to go look at the wildebeests. I\u2019m going to stay around and try to communicate with that.\n\nIn some respects, it\u2019s impossible to avoid anthropomorphizing. And so the question is, how do we step back a little and gain a different perspective? When we look at the messages we have sent out so far, often, it\u2019s been an attempt to express what we think is so important about ourselves. But the more interesting thing from an alien\u2019s perspective is to reverse the process and say, what is it that we could teach another civilization? I agree with Michio when he says that civilizations could be thousands or millions of years more advanced than we are. And in fact, if we\u2019re going to make contact, that\u2019s virtually a necessity. So we\u2019ve had the technology to communicate at interstellar distances for a century. If that\u2019s the norm, if civilizations don\u2019t reach that point that Michio is talking about, they have radio civilization for 100 years. They either turn inward and become contemplative. They destroy themselves in a nuclear war. We\u2019ll never make contact. So the only way we make contact is if they have been at this much longer than we are. And presumably, they are a much more stable, long-lived civilization. And then you have to ask what is it that any of these civilizations need to do to us? What is it that they\u2019re so intent on eradicating us? If, as Michio says from some of the Hollywood movie analogies, they want our Earth, they want our energy, again, it doesn\u2019t matter what we do. I think the big issue involving METI, Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is are we providing any additional risk by doing that? And that\u2019s what I just don\u2019t find plausible. But again, for those civilizations that are much longer lived than we are, I think the most interesting thing that we can talk about is something that they may have forgotten. What we have to offer is to hold a mirror up to them to let them remember what it was like to be a civilization at an earlier stage of development. So in the same way, that entomologists are fascinated by ants and study their communication in great detail, we may well have the equivalent of entomologists on other worlds wanting to understand us in our own terms.\n\nWell, with all due respect, I think that there is a fundamental flaw in this entire reasoning. We assume that they\u2019re benign. We assume that the aliens have our interests in mind. We assume that the aliens want to study us perhaps, but maybe they don\u2019t want to study us. Maybe we\u2019re just in the way. Look at history, not just the history of humans, but the history of animals. Where did Darwin get this idea of survival of the fittest? By looking at the animal kingdom, where animals fight. They fight for limited resources. They kill each other. One species dominates over the other. That\u2019s the law not just of human history, that\u2019s the law of all life on the planet Earth. Where in human history do we have an example of where technologically different civilizations meet and when it becomes benevolent and takes care of and make sure that the other lesser developed civilization has all the comforts of home? And then it was mentioned that you cannot take back what is already sent. Yes, that\u2019s true. However, what we send out there is fairly faint, fairly feeble. Now people want to project beamed images, beamed information that is many times more powerful than \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d coming out of a TV antenna, beaming messages to the nearby stars, select stars. And I think that\u2019s a very bad idea. Let\u2019s face it. If aliens are that advanced, they already have been monitoring our communication system. There\u2019s not going to be any miscommunication of communications between them because they\u2019ve been monitoring us already. So I don\u2019t see communication being the big problem. I see the big problem is, what do they want? If you can tell me what they want, then I will concede defeat on this question. But until you tell me what they want, my position is, this is the worst mistake we can make in human history.\n\nWell, I think there are some people who would say, well, we know they\u2019re out there, or we even think they\u2019ve visited. So finally, the scientists are fessing up. So for some people, it won\u2019t be a surprise. I think for other people, in the short-term, it may be a bit of a blow to the ego. Michio was talking about the revolutions that we have had in science. So Copernicus decentered us, so the Earth is no longer the center of the universe. That was a bit of a blow. Darwin, who we\u2019ve talked about quite a bit, said that humanity is not at the apex of evolution. And so now we would have more evidence that we aren\u2019t so special, that there are other intelligent beings out there. But I think that\u2019s the initial response because the more we come to know about that civilization, the more we will come to realize that no matter what its shape, what its form, it may have a different culture, a different history, different capabilities, but nowhere, given all of the vicissitudes of evolution, is there ever going to be another human civilization. And so I think that concern that some people may have that we\u2019re going to lose our sense of uniqueness is not something to be concerned about at all. That, in fact, we will have a greater sense of our uniqueness and as a species and our greater sense of our unity across cultures, across ethnic groups than we have right now.",

            "content": "There\u2019s been a lot of talk through the pandemic of travel \u2018coming back better\u2019. More people seem to have had a genuine realisation about the devastating effects of our travel habits \u2013 namely, the impact of over-tourism, \u2018thoughtless\u2019 travel and the frequency of flying. The fact that many of us have had to \u2018pause\u2019 our exploring for over a year, has meant that we have been able to actually witness some of the world\u2019s beauty spots without the presence of swarms of tourists, and seen how the inherent wildlife in these places have flourished without us being there. In short, when travel resumes again, there\u2019s hope that tourists will give more thought about their impact on the planet.\n\nBut how many of us actually know what this means in reality? Do we really understand how we can effectively put this desire into practice?\n\nTravel expert and writer Holly Tuppen has pondered the issue a lot. Back in 2008 she embarked on a 20-month around-the-world-without-flying adventure, which cemented her interest in sustainable travel. On her return, she began to work for no-fly platform Green Traveller and was editor of Green Hotelier. In addition, as communications manager at the International Tourism Partnership (ITP), she helped to shape corporate social responsibility strategies for the world\u2019s largest hotel chains.\n\nA specialist in the field, she has now written a new book \u2013 Sustainable Travel: The Essential Guide to Positive-Impact Adventures (published on 22 June, \u00a318, White Lion Publishing). The title provides travellers with everything they need to know to make more sustainable, responsible and ethical choices to ensure their travel experiences do more good than harm.\n\nAs well as explaining topics, such as what slow travel means and how to pack responsibly, the book also reveals the world\u2019s best regenerative travel experiences and tells you how to go about travel in a more sustainable way. \u201cWhen it comes to travelling responsibly, there\u2019s no quick win,\u201d Holly says.\u201dThis book is not all glossy, like many other travel titles. I raise some hefty questions. Sustainability is complex, and we need open debate and mindful actions to progress.\u201d\n\nHere, exclusively for Forbes, Holly Tuppen delves more into the subject of the book and the passion behind it.\n\nIs it an oxymoron to say \u2018sustainable travel\u2019?\n\nWe are slowly realising that travel can be sustainable, but only if we acknowledge that there isn\u2019t time or space for unlimited growth. For several years, I\u2019ve struggled with this tension. On the one hand, travel brings inspiration, creates connections, and can renew people and places. On the other, it undermines local lives, causes environmental damage, and has become an unrelenting commodity.\n\nRather than battle it, I\u2019ve come to accept this lurching between the highs and lows of travel. It keeps me in check and encourages me to challenge. It stops me greedily jumping on a plane at every opportunity and helps me to embrace doorstep adventures. When I do get on a plane, it drives me to make it count by supporting the change-makers and telling their story; since tourism was knocked sideways by Covid-19, this is more important than ever.\n\nWhat prompted your round-the-world-without-flying adventure? What were the main things that you \u2018learnt\u2019 from that experience?\n\nWe wanted an adventure that took us to unexpected places and challenged us physically and mentally. So much of our life is carefully curated; overland travel snatches any notion of control and hands your fate over to strangers, the elements, and the open road. It throws grit and beauty at you in equal measure, and there\u2019s no knowing where the magic will sweep you up.\n\nI learnt so much \u2013 such as: how much richer life is when you choose to trust strangers and take risks; how similar we all are in our needs and aspirations; how you can\u2019t judge anyone until you fully understand their unique context, and that adventure is everywhere if you\u2019re open to it. I hope I'll never forget how tiny and insignificant we felt becalmed in the middle of The Atlantic.\n\nDo you think the effects of the pandemic will have a positive impact on the way we will travel? Or is there a danger \u2013 due to pent-up demand \u2013 that people will just travel anywhere, without thinking about their impact?\n\nA bit of both. There is pent up demand, and that\u2019s a worry. I\u2019ve heard reports of snorkelling boats taking up to 600 people a day to fragile reefs in places across South East Asia. People are understandably desperate to make money, and so visitor number limits go out the window.\n\nBut there\u2019s also much to be optimistic about. Covid-19\u2019s forced pause has led many travel companies and hotels to embed sustainability and regenerative practices into business operations. Most businesses wouldn\u2019t have had the time or inclination to do this if life had carried on as before. For example, nearly 300 companies have signed up to the Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency initiative. Consumers have also had time to reflect and connect with landscapes, people, and nature closer to home, inevitably changing their travel aspirations and needs. Travellers are also savvier than ever when it comes to responsible business and demanding greater transparency.\n\nMeanwhile, destinations have had a taste of what life is like without tourists, which has helped to readdress the visitor/resident balance. Places like Amsterdam, for example, have started to move the red-light district out of the city centre. Venice is finally standing up to cruise ships (albeit with a chequered start). New Zealand has revamped its sustainability commitment, emphasising how communities can benefit from visitors.\n\nIt\u2019s a big question \u2013 but how imminent is the climate crisis?\n\nIt\u2019s here and no longer a distant threat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) state that a 1.5\u00b0C increase in global warming is the limit the planet can handle. At the current trajectory, it is estimated that we will reach the 1.5\u00b0C limit as early as 2030. To halt our advance beyond it, we need to cut carbon emissions in half by then globally. To put this in context, we need to reduce carbon to the same extent we have during Covid-19 every year.\n\nIf we reach 3\u00b0C of global warming in the next century, sea levels will rise by three feet, displacing 680 million people in low-lying coastal zones, along with 65 million citizens of small island states. That\u2019s not to mention the fires, extreme weather events and drought.\n\nAccording to the UN Refugee Agency, in 2019, weather-related hazards triggered some 24.9 million displacements in 140 countries. It predicts that by 2050 climate-related disasters could double the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance to over 2,000 million each year.\n\nHow would you sum up what \u2018sustainable travel\u2019 really means to those who may be confused by some of the jargon that is often used?\n\nThe World Tourism Organization, The United Nations\u2019 agency, defines sustainable tourism as \u201ctourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors needs, the industry, the environment and host communities\u201d.\n\nBut such a vague definition is no longer fit for purpose. Surely the needs of visitors and the travel industry should come after the needs of the environment and host communities? Is now the time to move beyond taking account of the negative and instead positively impact wherever we go?\n\nRather than dwelling on the notion of sustainability (where sustainability simply means being able to continue over and over again), perhaps now, in the midst of an urgent environmental crisis, we need to seek out transformative and regenerative experiences: travel that funds the protection of nature; travel that empowers marginalised parts of society; travel that is designed and driven by communities; travel that helps us learn from indigenous peoples; travel that heals; travel that brings us closer to our doorstep natural and cultural heritage; travel that uplifts the host as much as the visitor; travel that changes hearts and minds for the better.\n\nWhat top three things can we all do to ensure we travel better?\n\u2022 Taking responsibility for our carbon emissions is vital. This doesn\u2019t mean never flying again or only eating foraged seeds, but it does mean educating ourselves about what impact every single action we take has on the planet. We need to be a little more mindful about our decisions, like travelling less but for longer.\n\u2022 Considering the impact of our trips from the perspective of the destination is also important. It helps to take a moment to flip roles and ask a few questions. Would you like tourists snapping photos of your kids at school? Would it feel fair if only visitors were allowed in a fenced-off section of your local park? Where does the water come from to keep that golf course green? How do local people and the environment really benefit from your snorkelling with a marine biologist? By putting ourselves in the shoes of the place and people we visit, we\u2019re more likely to seek experiences that have a positive impact.\n\u2022 We also need to tackle tourism\u2019s economic leakage problem, where money mostly leaves a destination to benefit multi-nationals or international companies rather than local lives. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), for every $100 spent by a tourist on a holiday to a developing country, only $5 remains in the host community. The best way to solve the problem is to seek out locally-owned businesses from tour operators. Now, more than ever, we also need to embrace travel\u2019s potential to transform, connect and inspire us to contribute to a greener and fairer society.\n\nWhat is the biggest threat to our planet, as a consequence of mass travel?\n\nUntil we find a way to fly without fossil fuels, aviation is the thorn in the side of a greener travel industry. Although only accountable for 2-3% of global carbon emissions, the predicted growth of the aviation sector is what\u2019s most alarming, as more people gain the income needed to travel. Between 2015 and 2020, carbon emissions from aviation shot up 32 per cent, yet only 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population flies (pre-Covid). As more people travel, we urgently need to decarbonise the sector.\n\nPutting that to one side, the destruction of nature for the sake of new cruise ports, hotel developments, and infrastructure is a vast and devastating threat. It not only destroys ecosystems, which we urgently need to sink carbon from the atmosphere and maintain the biodiversity needed to sustain all life (including ours) on earth, but it often destroys local, more sustainable livelihoods, like small-scale farming and fishing. In the worse cases, it can ruin local lives by removing natural defences against flooding and wildfires or draining critical water supplies. I\u2019ve had some devastating conversations with conservationists, from Asia to South America, about what is going on unnoticed during the Covid crisis.\n\nIt can be overwhelming to think of the scale of the problem, do you think as individuals we can actually make a difference? Or is it really about large corporations and governments insisting on change?\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly overwhelming, but we\u2019re all part of the system and have a role to play. Governments and corporations are more likely to act when there\u2019s rising consumer or voter pressure, so where we choose to spend our money, the questions we ask, and the experiences we celebrate all matters. We can even use our travels to amplify marginalised voices or expose exploitation, which is incredibly powerful.\n\nAlthough it may seem like there\u2019s a lot to consider when planning a sustainable trip, it\u2019s worth remembering that taking a few actions is better than taking none at all \u2013 no single trip is going to be perfect. Our travel choices sit within our broader impact on the planet. Someone might choose to be vegan to justify a flight once a year; another might forgo flights altogether because they prefer to eat meat. We simply need to chip away at the various negative impacts we make and prioritise positive ones where possible.\n\nAs a travel writer, what is your dream trip (without the guilt)?\n\nI long to jump on a train to travel across Europe again. Before the pandemic hit, we were due to travel overland by train to Athens and make our way up Greece\u2019s emerald spine to the mountains and lakes of Zagori. Pure holiday indulgence without the carbon guilt!\n\nWhen it comes to long-haul, the most potent examples of positive impact travel often revolve around conservation. If my tourism dollars can help to shift landowners or communities from extractive land uses to regenerative ones, like rewilding, I feel pretty good about that. I do a lot of work with The Long Run, a membership organisation of lodges and tourism businesses that own or influence an essential ecosystem. Having worked closely with members during the pandemic, like Borana Conservancy in Kenya, Tswalu Kalahari Reserve in South Africa, Batu Batu Eco Island Resort in Malaysia, and Kasiiya Papagayo in Costa Rica, I\u2019m itching to go and meet some of the inspiring people I\u2019ve been grateful to connect with virtually over the last 18 months.\n\nIt can be hard to find the motivation, but channelling a sense of adventure close to home is always rewarding, whether embarking on a night hike, volunteering in the local community, or getting a little braver with cold-water swimming. I love that tour operators like Byway Travel, and Much Better Adventures push us in the direction of low-impact trips, just moments from home.\n\nWhere next on your wish list and why?\n\nThere\u2019s something symbolic about hopping across to France. Whether Paris by Eurostar or Dieppe by ferry, stepping on French soil right now would feel like progress and freedom. Once I\u2019ve mastered that, I\u2019m eyeing up some long hikes, like the Transcaucasian Trial, and I\u2019d love to be thrown together with a group of inspiring strangers on one of Orbis Expeditions\u2019 Skill Sharing trips in Malawi.\n\nYou can buy Holly\u2019s book \u2013 Sustainable Travel: The Essential Guide to Positive Impact Adventures \u2013 at Amazon and Bookstore.org.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a reason that venture capital-backed mental and behavioral health startups in the U.S. received nearly $2 billion in funding in the first few months of 2021, according to Dealroom data. From investors, entrepreneurs and digital health startups, to providers, employers and health plans, stakeholders are doubling down on innovative solutions, tech-focused partnerships and new care models to address the country\u2019s urgent need for better, more accessible behavioral health care.\n\nData from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) from 2019 shows that 20.6% of all U.S. adults \u2014 an estimated 51.5 million people aged 18 or older \u2014 experienced any mental illness (AMI). NAMI data also shows that one in every five teens has or will develop a serious mental illness \u2014 with 50% of all lifetime cases beginning by age 14, and most of those going undetected and untreated.\n\nThe pandemic hasn't made things any easier. Add physician shortages and the impact of Covid-19 to the equation \u2014 where 42% of U.S. adults reported anxiety and depression symptoms in 2020, up from 11% in previous years \u2014 and what the healthcare industry has is a behavioral health pandemic unto itself. But for one behavioral health leader, who knows the challenges of navigating mental healthcare access first hand, there\u2019s still an incredible amount of \u201cwhite space\u201d for continued innovation \u2014 and an opportunity to do better.\n\n\u201cI Want To Shine A Light Around The Challenge And Opportunity\u201d\n\nSolom\u00e9 Tibebu always knew that technology would drive opportunities in behavioral health care access and treatment, with her personal journey with mental illness starting as a teen. Today, as a behavioral health tech strategist who\u2019s passionate about health equity and access, Tibebu is committed to convening and connecting the right individuals, companies and investors to make progress in the field possible. She also hosts the Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech summit, the largest conference focused on virtual behavioral health access and innovation in the country, convening virtually on June 3.\n\nBelow, Tibebu weighs in on what the future of the behavioral health landscape looks like, conditions for its success, the white space that\u2019s ripe for disruption, and how new technologies, platforms and partnerships are helping consumers prioritize their mental health.\n\nQuestion: Investment in mental and behavioral health tech hit records in 2020, and we seem to be accelerating further. As an investor, consultant, and someone connected to innovators, what trends are you seeing?\n\n\u201cSome of the major trends have included the adoption of more explicit measurement-based care efforts integrated within virtual behavioral health solutions, expansion into other modalities of care such as coaching, and continued consolidation in the space. Per JAMA, measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. As payers and vendors seek to advance their understanding of cost and quality of the behavioral health interventions they deliver to members and patients, the adoption of more rigorous MBC tools is becoming more popular.\n\nAdditionally, many vendors are expanding their treatment modalities from just teletherapy with a mental health professional to things like virtual coaching. In the last several weeks, Meru Health and Doctor On Demand announced their new coaching offerings, and Ginger announced Cigna\u2019s coverage of their coaching benefit. Finally, tons of funding is going into condition-specific startups including those focused on substance use care, autism and more.\u201d\n\nQ: What kinds of behavioral health innovations and solutions are impressing you most?\n\n\u201cMany companies are getting more sophisticated about how they integrate physical and behavioral health solutions. For so long, mental health has been left out of the mainstream healthcare system. But when we treat behavioral health issues in patients, there is a significant impact on overall physical health, too. Companies like Magellan Health, Ontrak and Vida Health are some of the organizations that are making a difference, and will be talking more about how they are taking a unique approach to address whole-person care at the Going Digital summit.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, as the space starts to mature, it\u2019s exciting to see new companies expand into more focused, condition-specific and population-specific solutions. While early startups in the space address mental health issues like mild and moderate anxiety and depression more broadly, now we have startups like nOCD for virtual obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) care and Equip for virtual eating disorder care. These companies are founded by passionate founders with deep condition expertise and understand the specific nuances of delivering virtual care for those conditions.\n\nnOCD helps people reclaim their lives with clinically-proven OCD treatment, by removing barriers to care and reducing the stigma associated with OCD. Their innovative telehealth platform lets members quickly access a national network of licensed therapists who specialize in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), the \u201cgold standard\u201d for OCD treatment. nOCD will be presenting their breakthrough independent research study with Santa Barbara Actuaries based on millions of de-identified national healthcare claims that will reveal the prevalence of OCD in the U.S. population, the levels of care that OCD patients transition through, and the comparative costs of different treatments.\n\nEquip recently announced a Series A financing round worth $13 million led by Optum Ventures along with .406 Ventures and F-Prime Capital to scale their model, which has totally disrupted care delivery for this condition. Equip makes gold-standard eating disorder care accessible to all people through Family-Based Treatment (FBT) delivered at home for lasting recovery. Created by experts in the field and people who\u2019ve been there, Equip builds upon this model of care by providing families with a dedicated five-person care team including a therapist, dietitian, physician, and peer & family mentor.\u201d\n\nQ: Is there still a white space ripe for disruption?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! One area that is really heating up in just the last year is companies focused on youth mental health, so much so that we needed to add an entire Youth Track at the summit, specifically aimed at highlighting the many novel interventions for children, adolescents and young adults. The track is co-sponsored by Hopelab, a social innovation lab focused on designing science-based technologies to improve the health and well-being of teens and young adults, and the Telosity fund, a venture fund aimed at investing in extraordinary founders harnessing technology to improve mental well-being in young people.\n\nYouth have struggled so much throughout this pandemic, and I\u2019m proud to be able to host a panel with some of our Upswing Fund for Adolescent Mental Health grant recipients to hear how they are delivering much needed-services digitally for LGBTQ+ youth and adolescents of color, in particular. The Upswing Fund for Adolescent Mental Health is a philanthropic fund that I lead, seeded by Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company created by Melinda Gates, to advance social progress in the United States.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing how companies include or address caregiver resources to support a variety of conditions. Additionally, there is still a lot of opportunity for companies to address serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI), but a few startups are just starting to emerge to address it.\u201d\n\nQ: Are there any employers that you believe have gotten workforce mental health support \u2018right\u2019, especially over the past year? If yes, what does that look like and what are some of the necessary components of success?\n\n\u201cOne example I\u2019m looking forward to highlighting is the work taking place at YouTube. Dr. Jessica DiVento, Psy.D., chief mental health advisor at YouTube, will be joining us at the summit to discuss the many ways the company is supporting employee mental health. They have been thoughtful to make sure they have mental health services for all levels of care, through a variety of different means. This is important because with such a large and diverse workforce, they are able to offer different entry points to support employees' access to mental health care in ways that they want to engage.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean much to just invest in mental health solutions for employees if it isn\u2019t promoted properly. YouTube has been thoughtful about marketing the various tools and resources to employees far and wide, but also engaging every individual, department, and executive leadership team to promote the solutions as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important that everyone from peers, direct managers, to senior leadership are all on board to build a culture of mental health and wellbeing, and that they facilitate formal channels for each of those stakeholders to discuss and promote mental health.\u201d\n\nQ: As the telemedicine industry continues to work for broader reimbursement and policymaker support, creating more access for at-risk groups will make a strong argument. What\u2019s required to improve mental healthcare access to vulnerable and underserved populations?\n\n\u201cFor many individuals, significant barriers continue to exist for underserved populations to access quality mental health care. Everything from increased stigma in certain communities to a lack of addressed social determinants of health (SDoH) can lead to underserved communities not being able to get appropriate behavioral health services.\n\nOne example of an organization doing a great job of expanding access to care is CommonSpirit Health, a national nonprofit health system serving communities at more than 1,000 care sites and 137 hospitals across 21 states. The organization has a new partnership with Concert Health, a collaborative care startup. Together, the organizations are placing CommonSpirit\u2019s primary care physicians (PCPs) at the center of all physical and behavioral aspects of care by connecting patients with Concert Health\u2019s remotely located behavioral health care managers, who provide therapy and develop a behavioral health care plan for each patient.\n\nThe partnership between CommonSpirit and Concert Health is based on Collaborative Care Management, an evidenced-based model proven to improve behavioral health conditions such as depression and anxiety within the primary care setting. This is important because there is a lot of drop-off between a PCP making a referral to a behavioral health specialist and the patient actually being able to see that behavioral health specialist, for many of the barriers I named earlier. By empowering PCPs to have access to behavioral health specialists right at their fingertips, they are able to get the patient the quality mental health support they need. Additionally, this partnership with Concert Health enables CommonSpirit to provide a seamless, integrated physical and mental health experience.\u201d\n\nQ: Are there any technology companies or initiatives making a measurable impact?\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m proud to see is more VC funding going to entrepreneurs who represent the underserved populations they\u2019re working to impact. Kevin Dedner, founder and CEO of Hurdle Health, recently announced $5 million in seed funding from .406 Ventures, Seae Ventures and F-Prime. Hurdle is a digital mental-health platform revolutionizing mental-health care by providing mental-health services with a focus on culturally sensitive self-care support for people of color. While this is great news, there still needs to be so much more funding going toward entrepreneurs of color and LGBTQ+ founders in healthcare and beyond.\n\nIn addition to Hurdle Health, I\u2019m pleased to have other culturally-sensitive companies at the Going Digital Conference. Having experienced the difficulties of finding culturally competent care first hand as a queer individual, and while building Oscar Health, Gaurang Choksi is now building the healthcare industry's first cultural competency credentialing system, Violet.\n\nAt Violet, they believe that improving access to culturally competent care requires improving the underlying dataset and building a platform that functions as the \"credit score\" for cultural competence. This will enable the industry to identify the best providers for each community, and help cultural minorities like Gaurang access the healthcare they deserve.\n\nAdditionally, Candlelit Therapy, founded by Lauren Elliott, offers a safer, simpler way to find and book culturally responsive mental health information, resources and providers and centers the emotional and mental health needs of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and the LGBTQIA+ birthing parents.\u201d\n\nQ: Your event, Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech, is taking place virtually on June 3, 2021. Who is the event for and what are some of the \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d sessions/topics that will be covered?\n\n\u201cThe Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech summit is the largest conference focused on virtual behavioral health access and innovation. The summit convenes health plans, employers and benefits professionals, health systems, providers, investors, and startups to share best practices for deploying effective, scalable behavioral health solutions to all individuals in light of COVID-19 and beyond. The virtual forum will showcase the changing technological, reimbursement, and policy landscape for telehealth and other virtual behavioral health solutions.\u201d\n\nQ: What was the catalyst for the event - why was it needed?\n\n\u201cUltimately, I want to shine a light around the challenge and opportunity to expand access to underserved populations in several ways: in terms of expanding access to mental health services through technology and innovation and even creating a conference platform like Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech that is more accessible. From the fact that the conference is FREE for all attendees, to the virtual-first setup, and finally with the fact that proceeds go to a nonprofit like the Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective, we\u2019ve thought of every detail to bring more innovators, payers, employers, providers, investors and policymakers of all backgrounds into the conversation to expand access to mental health for all. I\u2019m thrilled that we could create a platform for so many unique voices to share their advances, innovations and efforts in this space.\u201d\n\nQ: What should folks know about BEAM, the organization to which proceeds from the conference are going?\n\nBlack Emotional and Mental Health Collective (BEAM) is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit collective of advocates, yoga teachers, artists, therapists, lawyers, religious leaders, teachers, psychologists and activists committed to the emotional/mental health and healing of Black communities. Their mission is to remove the barriers that Black people experience getting access to or staying connected with emotional health care and healing. They do this through education, training, advocacy and the creative arts.\n\nAbout Solom\u00e9 Tibebu: Solom\u00e9 Tibebu is a behavioral health technology strategist passionate about health equity and access.

            "content": "There\u2019s a reason that venture capital-backed mental and behavioral health startups in the U.S. received nearly $2 billion in funding in the first few months of 2021, according to Dealroom data. From investors, entrepreneurs and digital health startups, to providers, employers and health plans, stakeholders are doubling down on innovative solutions, tech-focused partnerships and new care models to address the country\u2019s urgent need for better, more accessible behavioral health care.\n\nData from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) from 2019 shows that 20.6% of all U.S. adults \u2014 an estimated 51.5 million people aged 18 or older \u2014 experienced any mental illness (AMI). NAMI data also shows that one in every five teens has or will develop a serious mental illness \u2014 with 50% of all lifetime cases beginning by age 14, and most of those going undetected and untreated.\n\nThe pandemic hasn't made things any easier. Add physician shortages and the impact of Covid-19 to the equation \u2014 where 42% of U.S. adults reported anxiety and depression symptoms in 2020, up from 11% in previous years \u2014 and what the healthcare industry has is a behavioral health pandemic unto itself. But for one behavioral health leader, who knows the challenges of navigating mental healthcare access first hand, there\u2019s still an incredible amount of \u201cwhite space\u201d for continued innovation \u2014 and an opportunity to do better.\n\n\u201cI Want To Shine A Light Around The Challenge And Opportunity\u201d\n\nSolom\u00e9 Tibebu always knew that technology would drive opportunities in behavioral health care access and treatment, with her personal journey with mental illness starting as a teen. Today, as a behavioral health tech strategist who\u2019s passionate about health equity and access, Tibebu is committed to convening and connecting the right individuals, companies and investors to make progress in the field possible. She also hosts the Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech summit, the largest conference focused on virtual behavioral health access and innovation in the country, convening virtually on June 3.\n\nBelow, Tibebu weighs in on what the future of the behavioral health landscape looks like, conditions for its success, the white space that\u2019s ripe for disruption, and how new technologies, platforms and partnerships are helping consumers prioritize their mental health.\n\nQuestion: Investment in mental and behavioral health tech hit records in 2020, and we seem to be accelerating further. As an investor, consultant, and someone connected to innovators, what trends are you seeing?\n\n\u201cSome of the major trends have included the adoption of more explicit measurement-based care efforts integrated within virtual behavioral health solutions, expansion into other modalities of care such as coaching, and continued consolidation in the space. Per JAMA, measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. As payers and vendors seek to advance their understanding of cost and quality of the behavioral health interventions they deliver to members and patients, the adoption of more rigorous MBC tools is becoming more popular.\n\nAdditionally, many vendors are expanding their treatment modalities from just teletherapy with a mental health professional to things like virtual coaching. In the last several weeks, Meru Health and Doctor On Demand announced their new coaching offerings, and Ginger announced Cigna\u2019s coverage of their coaching benefit. Finally, tons of funding is going into condition-specific startups including those focused on substance use care, autism and more.\u201d\n\nQ: What kinds of behavioral health innovations and solutions are impressing you most?\n\n\u201cMany companies are getting more sophisticated about how they integrate physical and behavioral health solutions. For so long, mental health has been left out of the mainstream healthcare system. But when we treat behavioral health issues in patients, there is a significant impact on overall physical health, too. Companies like Magellan Health, Ontrak and Vida Health are some of the organizations that are making a difference, and will be talking more about how they are taking a unique approach to address whole-person care at the Going Digital summit.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, as the space starts to mature, it\u2019s exciting to see new companies expand into more focused, condition-specific and population-specific solutions. While early startups in the space address mental health issues like mild and moderate anxiety and depression more broadly, now we have startups like nOCD for virtual obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) care and Equip for virtual eating disorder care. These companies are founded by passionate founders with deep condition expertise and understand the specific nuances of delivering virtual care for those conditions.\n\nnOCD helps people reclaim their lives with clinically-proven OCD treatment, by removing barriers to care and reducing the stigma associated with OCD. Their innovative telehealth platform lets members quickly access a national network of licensed therapists who specialize in Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), the \u201cgold standard\u201d for OCD treatment. nOCD will be presenting their breakthrough independent research study with Santa Barbara Actuaries based on millions of de-identified national healthcare claims that will reveal the prevalence of OCD in the U.S. population, the levels of care that OCD patients transition through, and the comparative costs of different treatments.\n\nEquip recently announced a Series A financing round worth $13 million led by Optum Ventures along with .406 Ventures and F-Prime Capital to scale their model, which has totally disrupted care delivery for this condition. Equip makes gold-standard eating disorder care accessible to all people through Family-Based Treatment (FBT) delivered at home for lasting recovery. Created by experts in the field and people who\u2019ve been there, Equip builds upon this model of care by providing families with a dedicated five-person care team including a therapist, dietitian, physician, and peer & family mentor.\u201d\n\nQ: Is there still a white space ripe for disruption?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! One area that is really heating up in just the last year is companies focused on youth mental health, so much so that we needed to add an entire Youth Track at the summit, specifically aimed at highlighting the many novel interventions for children, adolescents and young adults. The track is co-sponsored by Hopelab, a social innovation lab focused on designing science-based technologies to improve the health and well-being of teens and young adults, and the Telosity fund, a venture fund aimed at investing in extraordinary founders harnessing technology to improve mental well-being in young people.\n\nYouth have struggled so much throughout this pandemic, and I\u2019m proud to be able to host a panel with some of our Upswing Fund for Adolescent Mental Health grant recipients to hear how they are delivering much needed-services digitally for LGBTQ+ youth and adolescents of color, in particular. The Upswing Fund for Adolescent Mental Health is a philanthropic fund that I lead, seeded by Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company created by Melinda Gates, to advance social progress in the United States.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing how companies include or address caregiver resources to support a variety of conditions. Additionally, there is still a lot of opportunity for companies to address serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI), but a few startups are just starting to emerge to address it.\u201d\n\nQ: Are there any employers that you believe have gotten workforce mental health support \u2018right\u2019, especially over the past year? If yes, what does that look like and what are some of the necessary components of success?\n\n\u201cOne example I\u2019m looking forward to highlighting is the work taking place at YouTube. Dr. Jessica DiVento, Psy.D., chief mental health advisor at YouTube, will be joining us at the summit to discuss the many ways the company is supporting employee mental health. They have been thoughtful to make sure they have mental health services for all levels of care, through a variety of different means. This is important because with such a large and diverse workforce, they are able to offer different entry points to support employees' access to mental health care in ways that they want to engage.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean much to just invest in mental health solutions for employees if it isn\u2019t promoted properly. YouTube has been thoughtful about marketing the various tools and resources to employees far and wide, but also engaging every individual, department, and executive leadership team to promote the solutions as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important that everyone from peers, direct managers, to senior leadership are all on board to build a culture of mental health and wellbeing, and that they facilitate formal channels for each of those stakeholders to discuss and promote mental health.\u201d\n\nQ: As the telemedicine industry continues to work for broader reimbursement and policymaker support, creating more access for at-risk groups will make a strong argument. What\u2019s required to improve mental healthcare access to vulnerable and underserved populations?\n\n\u201cFor many individuals, significant barriers continue to exist for underserved populations to access quality mental health care. Everything from increased stigma in certain communities to a lack of addressed social determinants of health (SDoH) can lead to underserved communities not being able to get appropriate behavioral health services.\n\nOne example of an organization doing a great job of expanding access to care is CommonSpirit Health, a national nonprofit health system serving communities at more than 1,000 care sites and 137 hospitals across 21 states. The organization has a new partnership with Concert Health, a collaborative care startup. Together, the organizations are placing CommonSpirit\u2019s primary care physicians (PCPs) at the center of all physical and behavioral aspects of care by connecting patients with Concert Health\u2019s remotely located behavioral health care managers, who provide therapy and develop a behavioral health care plan for each patient.\n\nThe partnership between CommonSpirit and Concert Health is based on Collaborative Care Management, an evidenced-based model proven to improve behavioral health conditions such as depression and anxiety within the primary care setting. This is important because there is a lot of drop-off between a PCP making a referral to a behavioral health specialist and the patient actually being able to see that behavioral health specialist, for many of the barriers I named earlier. By empowering PCPs to have access to behavioral health specialists right at their fingertips, they are able to get the patient the quality mental health support they need. Additionally, this partnership with Concert Health enables CommonSpirit to provide a seamless, integrated physical and mental health experience.\u201d\n\nQ: Are there any technology companies or initiatives making a measurable impact?\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m proud to see is more VC funding going to entrepreneurs who represent the underserved populations they\u2019re working to impact. Kevin Dedner, founder and CEO of Hurdle Health, recently announced $5 million in seed funding from .406 Ventures, Seae Ventures and F-Prime. Hurdle is a digital mental-health platform revolutionizing mental-health care by providing mental-health services with a focus on culturally sensitive self-care support for people of color. While this is great news, there still needs to be so much more funding going toward entrepreneurs of color and LGBTQ+ founders in healthcare and beyond.\n\nIn addition to Hurdle Health, I\u2019m pleased to have other culturally-sensitive companies at the Going Digital Conference. Having experienced the difficulties of finding culturally competent care first hand as a queer individual, and while building Oscar Health, Gaurang Choksi is now building the healthcare industry's first cultural competency credentialing system, Violet.\n\nAt Violet, they believe that improving access to culturally competent care requires improving the underlying dataset and building a platform that functions as the \"credit score\" for cultural competence. This will enable the industry to identify the best providers for each community, and help cultural minorities like Gaurang access the healthcare they deserve.\n\nAdditionally, Candlelit Therapy, founded by Lauren Elliott, offers a safer, simpler way to find and book culturally responsive mental health information, resources and providers and centers the emotional and mental health needs of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and the LGBTQIA+ birthing parents.\u201d\n\nQ: Your event, Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech, is taking place virtually on June 3, 2021. Who is the event for and what are some of the \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d sessions/topics that will be covered?\n\n\u201cThe Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech summit is the largest conference focused on virtual behavioral health access and innovation. The summit convenes health plans, employers and benefits professionals, health systems, providers, investors, and startups to share best practices for deploying effective, scalable behavioral health solutions to all individuals in light of COVID-19 and beyond. The virtual forum will showcase the changing technological, reimbursement, and policy landscape for telehealth and other virtual behavioral health solutions.\u201d\n\nQ: What was the catalyst for the event - why was it needed?\n\n\u201cUltimately, I want to shine a light around the challenge and opportunity to expand access to underserved populations in several ways: in terms of expanding access to mental health services through technology and innovation and even creating a conference platform like Going Digital: Behavioral Health Tech that is more accessible. From the fact that the conference is FREE for all attendees, to the virtual-first setup, and finally with the fact that proceeds go to a nonprofit like the Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective, we\u2019ve thought of every detail to bring more innovators, payers, employers, providers, investors and policymakers of all backgrounds into the conversation to expand access to mental health for all. I\u2019m thrilled that we could create a platform for so many unique voices to share their advances, innovations and efforts in this space.\u201d\n\nQ: What should folks know about BEAM, the organization to which proceeds from the conference are going?\n\nBlack Emotional and Mental Health Collective (BEAM) is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit collective of advocates, yoga teachers, artists, therapists, lawyers, religious leaders, teachers, psychologists and activists committed to the emotional/mental health and healing of Black communities. Their mission is to remove the barriers that Black people experience getting access to or staying connected with emotional health care and healing. They do this through education, training, advocacy and the creative arts.\n\nAbout Solom\u00e9 Tibebu: Solom\u00e9 Tibebu is a behavioral health technology strategist passionate about health equity and access.

For so long, mental health has been left out of the mainstream healthcare system. This is important because with such a large and diverse workforce, they are able to offer different entry points to support employees' access to mental health care in ways that they want to engage.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean much to just invest in mental health solutions for employees if it isn\u2019t promoted properly. \n\nIt\u2019s important that everyone from peers, direct managers, to senior leadership are all on board to build a culture of mental health and wellbeing, and that they facilitate formal channels for each of those stakeholders to discuss and promote mental health.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "He starts his shift before dawn working three industrial fryers at a frozen food factory. Jose Morales lifts a basket of burritos out of one vat of oil, hangs it to dry and dunks another in, all day juggling hot metal that has left mottled scars on his inner arms.\n\nAfter work, he guides his 30-year-old stepdaughter Sandy Vazquez in a wheelchair through an out-patient clinic in Willowbrook. Jose is well short of 5 feet, his slight stature common in the part of Mexico where he grew up, where indigenous Nahua blood runs deep.\n\nWhile he can barely see over Sandy\u2019s head as he pushes, he has always been the big man in her life, the one who took her to Toys R Us to get her first princess Barbie dolls, the one who chased her tormentors away \u2014 and who never once questioned her when she said she was a girl.\n\nFor Jose and his wife, Reyna, their transgender daughter brought out an iron sense of purpose: they had to protect her until she found her own safe place.\n\nThey are a tight knot of a family mounting a bare-bones battle for the American Dream from an apartment next to the Century Freeway in South Los Angeles. In recent years, Sandy had starting to feel comfortable going out to parties with cousins and friends.\n\nHer parents hoped she might be able to find a job and, some day, a partner who loved her.\n\nThe last year battered those hopes. The family caught COVID-19 in December and Reyna almost died of it before recovering. And in May, Sandy faced the prospect of losing her foot and lower leg from an infection.\n\nMortality has haunted them ever since with the dreaded question: What will she do when they\u2019re gone?\n\nJose and Reyna met 26 years ago as they sewed shirts and dresses at a garment factory in downtown L.A. He had come to California a decade before, escaping an austere existence in the small city of Iz\u00facar de Matamoros in the southern state of Puebla. His father had left the family when he was a baby, and his mother, unable to feed Jose and his brother, eventually indentured them to a local store owner. Morales was unloading boxes and arranging shelves at age 7 and never got more than four years of school. He joined the Army at 17 and came out two years later just as poor as he started.\n\nReyna left Acapulco for the same lack of opportunity. She needed to find work and send money back to her family so they could eat and have electricity.\n\nAs they chatted over their sewing machines, he showed genuine interest in her stories about the two young children she was raising alone, Sandy and her older brother, Arturo.\n\nThey went to quincea\u00f1eras, birthday parties, picnics in the park, lunches at McDonald\u2019s \u2014 always with her kids. The pair moved into an apartment in the Broadway-Manchester neighborhood of South L.A. Sandy quickly grew to love Jose as her real dad. He affectionately pet-named her Gorda, his chubby girl.\n\nSandy was clear how she saw herself from at least age 3. When Reyna bought a skirt and blouse for her niece, Sandy wanted it. At first, Reyna indulged her as long as she stayed inside the house. At around age 6, Sandy started painting her nails and putting on lipstick. One day, she went out in the front yard in her makeup to dance. Reyna yanked her in before the neighbors could see, and spanked her. It was a moment of panic that still causes Reyna to tear up with regret.\n\nSoon she came to realize she needed to let her child express herself. Reyna looked on with a mix of angst and joy as Sandy took her boombox out to the front yard and danced like Shakira or Thalia with a mop over her head. The neighbor boys laughed. Sandy didn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\nIn Mexico, they knew that people like Sandy, as they became teenagers and older, were routinely beaten up, even killed. And Jose or Reyna were devout Catholics, going every Sunday to a church that wholly rejects the concept of transgender identity.\n\nBut they saw a simple, elemental truth: Sandy was their girl.\n\nIn grade school, Sandy still dressed like a boy and used her male birth name. She made friends and mostly avoided harassment, until she went with her mom to get her ears pierced. Soon after on the playground, a boy purposefully threw a utility ball at the side of her head when she wasn\u2019t looking. Sandy came home with a bloody ear and a missing earring.\n\nAfter that, letting her to go to school every day was agony for Reyna and Jose. They wanted to protect her, but they didn\u2019t have the time to be there at lunch or after school. They worked in the garment factory all day, came home for dinner and a nap, and then cleaned offices for seven or eight hours at night.\n\nBy 2001, they had saved enough to buy a 1979 Chevy stake-bed truck and start a little mobile corner store from the back. Fresh food was hard to get in South L.A., so they stocked fruit and vegetables, as well as juices, sodas and candies. They called the business La Jefa Products after la jefa, the boss \u2014 Reyna \u2014 and soon made enough to buy a second truck.\n\nThey drove to downtown in the morning to stock up on supplies and sold around their neighborhood all day.\n\nIn four years, Reyna and Jose found a spacious home in South L.A., divided into two apartments, on a dead-end street shaded by eucalyptus trees on the Century Freeway embankment. The price was hefty, $510,000. But they qualified for subprime mortgage and second loan, putting only $12,000 down.\n\nJose felt he was escaping the crushing poverty that seemed to be his fate. And in a new neighborhood, and new school, Sandy felt she could finally be who she wanted to be.\n\nOn her first day of middle school, she wore jeans with a blouse, makeup and earrings \u2014 and introduced herself as Sandy.\n\nThe hatred did not take long to show its teeth. First it was just boys snickering and pointing. Then when teachers weren\u2019t around, a group began to shove Sandy and hit her. Soon they were frisking her every day as if they were security guards, stealing any money she had, taking her phone, punching her.\n\n\u201cI told most of my teachers I was transgender,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cI wanted them to refer to me as she. But one of the teachers, she wasn\u2019t having it. She\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re a boy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis provoked other students. \u201cIs she a he or is he a she?\u201d one asked.\n\n\u201cPull his pants down and you can see who he is,\u201d the teacher replied.\n\nHer parents didn\u2019t speak English and couldn\u2019t confront the teacher. But they had to try to stop the attacks.\n\nJose went to the school to confront the culprits. As Sandy came out after the bell, a boy stopped her and started taking her things.\n\n\u201cHey, que traes?\u201d Jose called out. What\u2019s up? The boy bolted but Jose ran after him caught him, brought him to the principal and told him what happened.\n\nThe memory of this time brings Reyna to sobs.\n\n\u201cWe felt so powerless,\u201d Reyna recalls. \u201cTo see how they were treating her and not being able to do anything. And all because she just wanted what she wanted to be.\u201d\n\nSandy was reading more and more online about gender identity, and educating her parents. But she was isolated from any sense of community that could give her a sense of solidarity. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody who felt the same way as myself,\u201d she says.\n\nBy the time Sandy landed in high school, the boys were bigger and the threats of violence more ominous. Her parents pulled her out.\n\nA therapist who regularly visited Sandy got her enrolled tuition-free at a private academic program in North Hollywood that specialized in teenagers who had troubles adapting in school. There were only two classes of 10 students each, and no one bothered her. Reyna drove her daughter the hour-plus trip each way every day, adding to increasingly long days at work.\n\nTheir business was coming under strain. People tend to notice good fortune in places where it is scarce, and neighbors started running their own trucks. Worse, a clique of the 18th Street Gang was starting a sideline racket extorting the street vendors.\n\nFirst it was just young teenagers asking for a free soda here, a chocolate bar there. But word spread and higher-ups in the clica confronted Jose demanding a weekly payment of $100 for each truck. They knew the extortionists since they were toddlers.\n\nJose and Reyna worked harder to make up for diminishing returns. When she dropped Sandy at home after school, she made her do the laundry, clean the kitchen and have the family dinner ready, while mom went back to work.\n\nThe gang threat took a toll on Reyna, who was terrified Jose would be shot. She had heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, and the stress made her health worse. As an undocumented immigrant, her Medi-Cal only covered emergency care.\n\nBut the big blow came from the banks. Two years after they signed their loan documents, their lenders raised their adjustable interest rates. Their mortgage payment jumped from $3,025 to $5,200.\n\nThe lead lender foreclosed as they continued to live in the back apartment and pay rent to a new owner. Jose swallowed the devastating blow and did the only thing he could do. Keep working.\n\nIn the streets, the gangs just got more menacing.\n\n\u201cLa renta!\u201d shouted a pistol-packing gangbanger in a wheelchair who was called El Wheelo.\n\n\u201cNo tengo,\u201d Jose said. He didn\u2019t have it.\n\nUltimately, it was not the gangs but the competition from other vendors that spelled the death for La Jefa Products. Jose and Reyna, who was increasingly ill, sold the trucks as he started working at different factories through a temp agency.\n\nAfter her junior year of high school, Sandy didn\u2019t return to public school. She rarely left the apartment, depressed for months on end. She was scared to go out alone and was shy in ways she never had been. She didn\u2019t want to work or go to college. She couldn\u2019t envision her future and developed a fantasy that she didn\u2019t have long to live.\n\nWhen she did go out with her cousins and their friends, Reyna would not sleep until Sandy got home, thinking about news stories she\u2019d seen about transgender women being killed in the street.\n\nOne summer day in 2018, her cousins persuaded Sandy to go to Hurricane Harbor, the water park in Santa Clarita. Walking barefoot on the hot pavement, she got a large blister on her foot. At 28, Sandy had diabetes like her mother, and in her depression, did not bother taking insulin or monitoring her sugar or weight, enabling the disease to damage the nerves and blood vessels in her feet.\n\nThe blister got infected and she went to the emergency room at Martin Luther King Community Hospital. A podiatrist, Dr. Myron Hall, cleaned out the wound and bandaged it, and told her to visit him at the out-patient clinic periodically to check on it.\n\nShe got better, but her mom\u2019s health continued to decline and in December, with her underlying conditions, she was hospitalized for severe COVID-19. All Reyna could think about was leaving Sandy behind and putting the full burden of supporting her on Jose. If she recovered, she wanted to ensure father and daughter were seen as family in the eyes of God.\n\nThe wedding was an act of their enduring hope. Reyna bought a custom-made pearl dress with gold lace from a storefront in Huntington Park. Jose wore a black suit and gold tie to match the dress. Sandy did Reyna\u2019s makeup, and sewed COVID masks made from the dress material. On April 24, the couple married at St. Michael\u2019s Church, the chapel they went to every Sunday.\n\nSandy was brightening up bit by bit, going out with her cousins and friends more often. Jose hoped she might get a job, maybe working in a nail salon, and find her life\u2019s path. Then a pedicurist accidentally reopened the wound on her foot. Dr. Hall cleaned it out again, but weeks later, Sandy walked on it too early, and got it wet in the shower.\n\nOn May 14, her foot throbbed in pain as she ran a fever and vomited. The wound-care nurse told her to go to the hospital immediately. Dr. Hall found necrotizing fasciitis \u2014 flesh eating bacteria \u2014 running through her foot up the inside of her leg. She was close to going into shock and dying. Hall did surgery that night to remove a piece on the side of the foot and told her she might need several more procedures before he would know if he could save her leg.\n\nReyna\u2019s mother had lost her foot to diabetic amputation in Acapulco. She pictured Sandy unable to get around the house, bed-bound and more depressed, no job, no partner, no family of her own, no end to her parents\u2019 protecting her.\n\nThe next day, Reyna, 60, suffered a stroke that paralyzed half her body.\n\nAfter three more surgeries, Dr. Hall saved Sandy\u2019s foot, her toenails still painted white for the wedding.\n\nWhen she got home, her dad asked, with his usual practicality, \u201cAre you hungry Gorda? What can I make you?\u201d\n\nThese days Reyna and Sandy lie in bed all day under a poster-size photo of the wedding with Jose standing on his tiptoes. Arturo and his 12-year-old daughter, Destiny, come and go from work and school. Mom watches her favorite Turkish telenovelas dubbed in Spanish, Sandy keeps her foot elevated while using TikTok. Jose, 55, arrives home from his shift over the fryers in Cudahy and helps Reyna get to the bathroom, and then sits her in a chair; her insurance does not cover the rehabilitative therapy that her doctors told her could help her walk again one day.\n\nJose takes Sandy to see Dr. Hall at the wound care clinic. He shops for groceries and cooks their dinners and they all sit at the table by the back window, talking, teasing, worrying, laughing.\n\nJose asks if the food is good.\n\nSandy shrugs. \u201cEh, mas o menos,\"she says \u2014 more or less, a running joke since her dad took over the cooking.\n\nJose and Reyna see God\u2019s plan in Sandy keeping her foot. And for this, they remain steadfast: she will find her place.",

            "description": "\u2018In the Heights\u2019 and Colorism: What Is Lost When Afro-Latinos Are Erased  The New York Times",
            "content": "\u201cIn the Heights,\u201d the long-delayed Hollywood adaptation of the Broadway musical, has been heralded as a step for more Latino representation in Hollywood, but a conversation has emerged about colorism and the casting of the film. The New York neighborhood at the center of the story, Washington Heights, is predominantly Afro-Dominican. In an interview, Felice Le\u00f3n, a video producer for The Root, asked Jon M. Chu, the director, and some of the stars about the lack of dark-skinned leads in the film: \u201cAs a Black woman of Cuban descent specifically from New York City,\u201d she told him, \u201cit would be remiss of me to not acknowledge the fact that most of your principal actors were light-skinned or white-passing Latinx people.\u201d Chu said it was a conversation and something he needed to be educated about. In the end, he said, they \u201ctried to get the people who were best for those roles.\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is a part of the film\u2019s creative team, which includes the writer Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes, addressed the criticism last week in a statement on Twitter. He apologized for falling short in \u201ctrying to paint a mosaic of this community.\u201d Several prominent Latinos came to Miranda\u2019s defense, including the pioneering Latina actress Rita Moreno, who later backtracked her comments. It\u2019s not the first time Chu has had to contend with questions of identity. His box office hit \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d also had to address similar issues when it came to the casting of Asians and Asian-Americans in the film. (The lead actor in that film, Henry Golding, is biracial.)\n\nLike many people, my first trip back to the movies since the pandemic hit was to see \u201cIn the Heights\u201d on the big screen. It was a joyful moment, after a year where so much wasn\u2019t. It was thrilling to see brown bodies singing and dancing in a city that has been my home for nearly a decade. There has long been a lack of Latino representation in Hollywood, and \u201cIn the Heights\u201d was aimed as a step toward rectifying that. However, Le\u00f3n\u2019s interview raised important questions about colorism in the casting in the film, which is centered on a neighborhood that has a big Afro-Latino population. Did the creative team do enough when it comes to representation? CONCEPCI\u00d3N DE LE\u00d3N In my view, no. I\u2019ve been concerned about the issue of colorism in the film since the trailer was released. Aside from Leslie Grace, the Dominican-American actress who plays Nina, a Puerto Rican college student struggling with belonging and community at Stanford University, none of the lead actors are Afro-Latino. Hollywood has long valorized and highlighted fair-skinned Latinos over Afro-Latinos, often denying the latter roles that reflect their culture. It\u2019s a limited and inaccurate representation of Latinos, who are diverse in culture and complexion. But what makes these casting choices particularly egregious is that the movie is set in the Heights, which is known as Little Dominican Republic. At least 90 percent of Dominicans are of African descent, according to a recent population survey, and I am one of them. So why were we not prominently featured? As far as what the team could have done differently \u2014 it seems simple. They could have hired more Black Latino actors, not to fill a diversity quota, but because that would have reflected the truth of the neighborhood. Or at the very least, they could have been clearer that this film was not meant to represent them.\n\nWhat does colorism mean in the Latino community and what are the ways it manifests itself? What do we lose by not having a broad spectrum of representation in the arts? DE LE\u00d3N Colorism in the Latino community manifests itself similarly to how it does in the Black American community: The fairer your skin, the more beautiful and desirable you are perceived to be. My complexion was always a topic of conversation when I was growing up, and cousins of mine who are darker than me had it worse, often ridiculed with demeaning words like \u201cmona,\u201d meaning monkey, that are normalized but have racist undertones. In the Dominican Republic and elsewhere there is the concept of \u201cimproving the race\u201d by dating white, thereby lightening your lineage. It\u2019s a notion that has roots in colonization, when Spain implemented a caste system on the island of Hispaniola, which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti, that placed folks who were of European or mixed European descent higher on the social ladder and allowed them more opportunities to advance. Though this system no longer exists, there are still traces of it in how Black Latinos are viewed and treated. They are more impoverished and have less access to a quality education, housing or health care than fair-skinned Latinos. By erasing them onscreen, we are perpetuating this harm and furthering the narrative that only white is right. In my family (I am Mexican-American), I am darker skinned than some of my relatives and it earned me the nickname Prieta or dark-skinned. I have siblings and cousins who are fairer than me, even white-passing. While some might consider words like \u201cprieta\u201d terms of endearment, they can also be very damaging in that they convey a difference \u2014 you are not the norm, which is to say, white. GARCIA As someone who has existed in Black skin as a Latina my whole life, colorism is everywhere in Latinidad, an academic term that says Latinos share common threads of identity. The scars of colonization and a dictator that powdered his skin to appear lighter are still visible in Dominican culture. For people like myself, those scars are still very viscerally felt. I do believe that Dominicans are awakening to a Blackness that they have been taught to eschew, and I think there is more room for dark-skinned Dominicans now than ever before. That being said, the status quo is that lighter-skinned Latinos are better and many people are not ready to renounce that, for whatever reason. A.O. SCOTT That seems to be the case in a lot of Latin American cinema and television as well. It\u2019s rare to see Black or Indigenous protagonists in films from the Caribbean or Brazil, and rarer still to find directors from those backgrounds.\n\nThe film didn\u2019t have major stars in the lead roles because the creative team wanted to take a chance on newer talent. It seems like it could have been the perfect opportunity to prevent the colorism issues. Chu said that they selected the best actors for the roles. What did you think about his response? DE LE\u00d3N His response perpetuates the notion that Black actors are somehow less talented or capable than white actors, when in fact casting choices are often marred by personal biases and ingrained ideas about who is deserving or worthy of a lead role. It\u2019s no accident that Latinos onscreen are (mostly) fair-skinned. It\u2019s a reflection of a global culture of anti-Blackness. There have been some exceptions. Julissa Calderon is an Afro-Dominican with a prominent role on \u201cGentefied,\u201d the Netflix sitcom about the quickly changing Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. And newcomer Alycia Pascual-Pe\u00f1a, an Afro-Dominican from the Bronx, was one of the leads in the Amy Poehler-helmed \u201cMoxie.\u201d But these representations are rare. GARCIA People are very much used to the dark-skinned woman, still in 2021, playing the maid in the novela. As smart as Chu and Miranda are, they conformed just like everyone else does. There is absolutely no way that there wasn\u2019t a dark-skinned Black Latino to hire for a lead role. There are too many of us. It is easy to believe that rhetoric, but it is simply false. I do believe that people have been trained to believe that a Latino looks like Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Jennifer Lopez and Sofia Vergara, whatever their heritage. It takes a lot of conditioning to get here and there has been more than enough. This is a movie they wanted to sell and they perpetuated the idea that Black Latinos cannot sell a movie. HERRERA I would have loved to see someone like Jharrel Jerome in this film; he is a Black Dominican actor who was in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and won an Emmy for his role on Netflix\u2019s \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d There was an open casting call for \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d which is supposed to democratize the casting process and allow for more emerging talent to audition. So the point about not having enough major Black Latino stars seems baseless.\n\nMiranda issued an apology on Monday. It\u2019s unclear how much of a hand he had in the casting decisions for the film \u2014 he was one part of the creative team \u2014 but he is an important voice in Hollywood and on Broadway. What did you think about it? Is there unfair pressure put on Miranda, making him the stand-in for many issues involving the Latin community? DE LE\u00d3N That Miranda is being held to task for the representation of Black Latinos is a product of the continued lack of diversity in Hollywood. We don\u2019t have many heroes, or people to look to for Latino stories. That\u2019s not Miranda\u2019s fault, of course. He didn\u2019t create the dynamic. But to quote Spider-Man, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d \u2014 especially when your film is set in a Black Latino neighborhood. It raises the question of what stories are prioritized and why. It capitalizes on Blackness while ignoring Black people. His apology is welcome and warranted, but it is not the end of the conversation. GARCIA Because Miranda is such an iconic figure in Hollywood and Broadway, we feel even more deceived. This is obviously not entirely on him. Hollywood barely has the infrastructure to be fair to African American actors, let alone Black Latinos. With that said, because he behaved like he believed in Washington Heights wholeheartedly, we simply thought he saw us too. We thought he saw us at clubs, on the street, at bars, at the bodega with him. I think that is why this comes as such a shock to the Dominican community, because his vision did not meet his allegiance. I do appreciate the groundwork this lays for the other Latinos to be able to tell their singular stories on the big screen. Maybe a young Black Latina will watch \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and become inspired to tell her truth. Now she has a pathway to get there. For that I am grateful. PHILLIPS I do have to say that I sympathize with Miranda, because I recognize and appreciate all the great work he\u2019s done for the theater community, and all the great theater he has given us. This reminds me of the conversation we had about the \u201cHamilton\u201d streaming release last year and how fixated I was on the musical\u2019s near-erasure of slavery despite its subversive recasting of the founding fathers as people of color. I think his work is good and important and that he should be made aware \u2014 as any artist should \u2014 of his blind spots. But I agree with Concepci\u00f3n that he also shouldn\u2019t have to bear the full brunt of a problem that reflects issues in the industry at large.\n\nDE LE\u00d3N Of course it\u2019s OK to still love the film. It\u2019s not a binary discussion. I\u2019ve heard many people say they loved the film despite its shortcomings. There were many ways in which watching the film was gratifying \u2014 seeing my beloved Dominican flag not only depicted, but exalted onscreen was a joy, as was the depiction of common immigrant struggles such as yearning for your home country, making great sacrifices to make it in New York or struggling with finding community in college. Not to mention the food and a lot of the music (though I am still salty that bachata, quintessential to the Dominican Republic, was not more prominently featured). But none of this is enough. You can\u2019t celebrate pasteles en hoja without celebrating Black Dominicans. You can\u2019t celebrate salsa without recognizing that its percussion is inherited from African drums. Showcasing these cultural elements is no doubt important, but it cannot be divorced from or done in lieu of depicting Black Latinos themselves. GARCIA I enjoyed seeing Highbridge Pool in that beautiful musical number. I enjoyed the central role of the fire escape, the bodega, the food and the music. I identified with a lot of it. As a very Black presenting Latina, I\u2019m almost used to not seeing myself in Latino media, even when it is our culture that is being exalted. I am not speaking for all Black Latinos, but the realization of your nonexistence in such a cultural blockbuster simply hurts. The gaslighting that comes with the validation of our music and culture but the erasure of our bodies is almost normal. To crib from the 1990s \u201cSelena\u201d biopic, we are simply too Black for Latinos and too Latino for anyone else. PHILLIPS An important lesson is that whether it\u2019s a film or a play or whatever, the work begins with casting but doesn\u2019t end there. It\u2019s also about the story and the context. Creating art about brown and Black people isn\u2019t always as easy as we\u2019d like to think \u2014 or, to be more exact, creating good, nuanced art about brown and Black people isn\u2019t always as easy as we\u2019d like to think. HERRERA At its core, the act of criticism is a labor of love. We critique cultural objects because we have hope in them, and we want them to be better. I often think about a 2019 interview in The Nation with the poet and writer Hanif Abdurraqib. He talks about the notion that criticism is something that arises out of anger, bitterness or jealousy. To me, that anger is in service of something else: it allows us to imagine a more just political future. As he says, \u201cCritique, for me, has to be an act of love \u2014 or else it\u2019s a waste of time. And so I have to figure out a way to honor artists I care about while still understanding that my job isn\u2019t necessarily to bow to them.\u201d It also helps me interpret art outside of \u201cthis is good\u201d and \u201cthis is bad.\u201d SCOTT That is such an important point about criticism, which all too often is misconstrued as \u201chating\u201d or \u201ccanceling.\u201d On \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d the other night Rita Moreno tried to defend Miranda \u2014 \u201ca man who literally brought Latinoness and Puerto Ricanness to America\u201d \u2014 by in effect wishing his critics would just be quiet, or wait until some unspecified, more appropriate time. She has since apologized, and a recent documentary details the bigotry she faced throughout her career. In any case, protecting works of art from criticism does them no favors. It\u2019s as simplistic as dismissing them for their shortcomings. HERRERA I think an important aspect of this debate is that it has once again exposed the limitations of a conversation focused on representation. For so long, representation has been heralded as a solution to racism; moments like this really expose the farce of that idea. The argument is often that representation, especially in spaces where marginalized communities have historically been excluded, will save us from discrimination. But there are limits to what representation can do.\n\nWhen we focus all of our critical attention on representation and inclusion, it distracts us from the work of understanding the conditions that create racism in the first place. The conversation is not just about \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d or about the number of Latino creators in Hollywood \u2014 it\u2019s about the history of anti-Blackness, which has permitted white and lighter-skinned Latinos to appear most visible in all aspects of our culture. Just because there is a Latino in the room does not mean that they cannot perpetuate harmful systems of power, or that they are not capable of exclusion. So I want to end with a reminder to my fellow white Latinos, who have a unique responsibility to listen to these kinds of conversations. I\u2019m not going to sit on a high horse and pretend I am not complicit in these dynamics as a white Dominican woman. But I want us to think deeply about how we are using our privilege in these industries. Not to center whiteness in the conversation, but because we need to consider how we use our access to certain spaces and whether we are committed to anti-racist work in them, no matter how uncomfortable it may make us.",

            "content": "As we emerge from our homes to embrace the warmer weather, fears of the \u201cquarantine-15\u201d have people paying extra close attention to their diets. Weight loss companies are seeing a surge in sales as a result and the global market for health and wellness foods continues on course to reach its projected value of $1 trillion by 2027. While excess weight has been found to be a risk factor for complications due to COVID-19, worrying about the number on the scale only adds more stress to our already-taxed bodies. As people have gained pandemic pounds, they\u2019ve also become more anxious, depressed and sleep-deprived. Foods that nourish rather than deprive the body are needed now more than ever.\n\nHippocrates once said, \u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\u201d And while the relationship between what we eat and physical health outcomes is well-known, a growing field of research known as nutritional psychiatry is finding that what we eat affects our mental health too. For example, foods that promote the balance of bacteria in the gut affect the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which regulate mood and play a role in the development of psychiatric disorders. As the pandemic has taken a toll on our mental health, treating our food as medicine is a self-care strategy that\u2019s easily overlooked.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not so simple to put into practice. While food by its very nature is designed to fuel our bodies. The demands of modern industrialization and mass production have reduced the nutritional value of many shelf-stable foods. Promising minimally processed ingredients, plus added adaptogens or superfoods to boost nutrition, functional foods aim to fill the void. And people have been eating them up in quarantine\u2014from the home chef experimenting with vitamin-packed spice blends to the busy mom who needs a quick brain-boosting snack. With such a wide variety of options on the market, it\u2019s no surprise the pre-2020 trend is now booming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fad. The superfood category has been trending for some time,\u201d says Reno Rolle, founder of superfood company Boku. \u201cWith COVID, that trend has really gotten a shot in the arm with people\u2019s increased awareness of the importance of building immune function. Food is fuel and thank goodness more people are starting to realize it.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to boost the immune system, sleep better or feel less stressed, these functional foods go beyond nourishment to fuel the body and mind. Creative and delicious, they also represent some of the most innovative plant-based offerings on the market.\n\n\u201cIt's the idea of taking the best of everything around the world that I've tasted and putting it in a jar,\u201d founder Ada Yarungsee tells Forbes. \u201cGood food is good food, but good energy is magic!\u201d This oil gets its \u201cmagic\u201d from Ashwagandha\u2014an adaptogen that calms the nervous system\u2014and organic Thai chili peppers for a spicy kick. Made with extra virgin olive oil harvested using traditional methods, the smooth, tangy condiment supports small and independent farmers in the southern region of Italy.

            "description": "Tesla reports a big jump in profit.  The New York Times",
            "content": "A Tesla Model X charging in Berlin in 2019. Tesla sold more than twice as many cars in the second quarter as it did in the same period last year. Tesla on Monday reported a big increase in profit for the three months ending in June because it sold more than twice as many cars in the period as it did a year earlier. The company said it made $1.1 billion, or $1.02 a share, in the second quarter, up from $104 million in the same period a year earlier. It reported revenue of $12 billion, up from $6 billion. Tesla sold more than 200,000 electric cars in the quarter, up from about 91,000 a year earlier, when the coronavirus pandemic slowed sales and production for all automakers. Tesla sold 185,000 cars in the first quarter of 2021. \u201cPublic sentiment around E.V.s is at an inflection point,\u201d Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said Monday on a conference call, referring to electric vehicles. \u201cI think everyone agrees at this point that E.V.s are the way forward.\u201d A significant portion of Tesla\u2019s profit comes from selling regulatory credits to other automakers that need them to meet emissions standards. In the second quarter, it took in $354 million from the sale of credits. That compares with $428 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u201cThe delivery numbers are good, but a third of the profits still come from selling credits, profits that will continue to decline, not grow,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry. \u201cThe company is benefiting from its head start in E.V.s on the big car companies. As the competition ramps up, life will get tougher.\u201d Tesla has increased sales despite the shortage of computer chips, which serve as the brains for a variety of electronics, including engine controllers and touch screens. General Motors, Ford Motor and other manufacturers have had to idle plants because of the shortage. Mr. Musk has said the company has managed well during the shortage by switching to the kinds of chips that are more readily available and writing new instructions to be embedded in the chips \u2014 known as firmware. But on Monday he said that the company\u2019s growth would be affected by the shortage and that the company had had to idle some production because it could not get enough parts to make cars. \u201cThe chip is the governing factor in our output,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cThis is out of our control. It seems like it is getting better but it is hard to predict.\u201d Last month, he said on Twitter that the \u201cfear of running out\u201d of parts was compelling automakers to order more components than they needed, likening it to the hoarding of toilet paper by many Americans in the early months of the pandemic last year. The earnings report comes as Tesla is trying to lay the ground work for a new phase of growth. It is building new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin, and is getting ready to sell the Cybertruck, an angular pickup truck aimed at luxury car buyers. It is also trying to finish developing a long-delayed semi truck. Mr. Musk had once forecast it would be in production by 2019. In its statement, Tesla said it expected to start making the Model Y, its most popular vehicle, in Austin and Berlin by the end of the year, but it said production of the semi truck would be delayed until 2022 because of limited supply of batteries. It said the Cybertruck would go into production in Austin after the Model Y but did not say when that would happen. Tesla said its cash holdings of $16 billion were enough to fund its plans. The company said it still believed that sales would grow 50 percent a year on average for the next several years. The company is also contending with increasing competition from established and start-up automakers that are introducing electric cars. This year Ford started selling the Mustang Mach E, an electric sport utility vehicle that has sold well and taken market share from Tesla. Volkswagen has starting selling an ID.4, another S.U.V. Rivian, a start-up that has drawn billions of dollars in backing from Ford, Amazon and other investors, is expected to start delivering an electric pickup and S.U.V. in September. On Monday, another start-up, Lucid Motors, became a publicly traded company by completing a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Its stock closed up about 6 percent on Monday. Lucid is headed by a former Tesla engineer, Peter Rawlinson. The company is taking a similar approach to Tesla by first selling a pricey luxury sedan, and following up with more affordable models. Mr. Rawlinson has said Lucid has made technological advances that will allow its car, the Lucid Air, to travel about 500 miles on a full charge, about 100 miles more than the Tesla Model S.\n\nA lawyer known for fighting Chevron was found guilty of contempt of court by a federal judge. Chevron has asserted that Steven Donziger and his associates engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy and other criminal conduct. A lawyer who for decades has challenged Chevron on environmental grounds was found guilty of criminal contempt of court by a federal judge on Monday for disobeying court orders. The lawyer, Steven Donziger, who had already been disbarred and has spent roughly two years in home confinement in Manhattan, said he would appeal. The ruling is the latest episode in a long legal battle over the alleged dumping of oil in the Amazon region of Ecuador from the 1960s to the 1990s by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001. An Ecuadorean court ruled in favor of the Indigenous people in 2011 and ordered Chevron to pay $19 billion in damages, a penalty later reduced by a higher court to $9.5 billion. Mr. Donzinger was one of the lawyers who represented the plaintiffs in that case. Chevron refused to pay. Three years later, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled in favor of Chevron in a civil case the company filed against Mr. Donziger and his litigation team. The company asserted that Mr. Donziger and his associates had engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy and other criminal conduct, including ghostwriting an environmental report that was supposed to be by an independent expert and bribing an Ecuadorean judge. Judge Kaplan later found that Mr. Donziger did not abide by an order to turn over his electronic devices and that he had continued to try to profit from the original suit against Chevron. Mr. Donziger has disputed Judge Kaplan\u2019s ruling, even after it was upheld in an appeals court. He said giving up his electronic devices would jeopardize the interests of his clients. \u201cAt stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary,\u201d Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote in the Monday decision against Mr. Donzinger. Martin Garbus, a lawyer for Mr. Donziger, said he expected the decision would be reversed on appeal. Judge Preska \u201cis attempting to justify what cannot be justified,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nLordstown Motors workers in June at the company\u2019s factory in Ohio. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Lordstown Motors, a struggling electric pickup truck company, said Monday that it had reached a deal with an investment firm to raise $400 million over three years. The investment firm, Yorkville Advisors, has agreed to buy up to $400 million of Lordstown\u2019s shares, which would provide badly needed cash to a company that this summer said it could go out of business without raising more money. The deal is potentially quite lucrative to Yorkville because it will buy the stock for at least $7.48 a share, the closing price on Friday. If Lordstown stock rises, the hedge fund stands to make a profit. Yorkville agreed that it would not bet against Lordstown\u2019s stock. Lordstown also agreed to give Yorkville 371,000 shares, which are worth nearly $3 million based on the current stock price, for agreeing to the deal. Once hailed by former President Donald J. Trump as a savior of manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Lordstown has struggled to produce vehicles while spending hundreds of millions of dollars. The company is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Lordstown, which acquired a former General Motors factory in Lordstown, Ohio, went public in October by merging with DiamondPeak Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company led by a wealthy Wall Street real estate investor. SPACs raise money by selling stock before they have any assets, and then go shopping for a business. They offer the companies they merge with a way to list on the stock market with less disclosure and scrutiny than is typical in an initial public offering. The S.E.C. is investigating whether the company and its founder, Steve Burns, who resigned as chief executive in June, overstated claims about interest from commercial buyers in its electric truck, the Endurance. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the company\u2019s preorder claims and its merger with DiamondPeak. The company, which has beefed up its public relations operation in recent weeks, is being represented by lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell, a big New York law firm, in connection with the investigations. Mr. Burns has hired two lawyers from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, another big New York firm. Yorkville, which specializes in investing in small companies, is not without its own controversy. In 2012, the S.E.C. accused the firm of misvaluing its assets to hide losses from investors. But in 2018, a federal judge dealt a big blow to the S.E.C. by dismissing most of the civil fraud claims against Yorkville. Regulators and Yorkville ultimately agreed to dismiss the matter. Lordstown\u2019s stock price has tumbled from a peak of almost $31 in February and is now trading at less than the $10 price that DiamondPeak sold shares at during its initial public offering. The stock was down 2.5 percent at the close of trading on Monday.\n\nTwo insurance giants call off their planned merger after a Justice Dept. lawsuit. Two of the world\u2019s largest insurance brokers, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, announced that they had called off a planned $30 billion merger. Two of the world\u2019s largest insurance brokers, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, announced on Monday that they had called off a planned $30 billion merger, just a little more than a month after the Department of Justice sued to block the union. The announcement was a victory for the Biden administration. The case against the proposed merger was the first big trustbusting move by the administration, which has signaled a willingness to be tough on corporate consolidation. President Biden signed a sweeping executive order to address competition in industries as diverse as tech, railroads, and meat and poultry. And last week, he named Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer who has spent much of his career fighting Big Tech, to run the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. Mr. Biden has also named other critics of Big Tech to prominent roles, such as Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission, and Tim Wu to an economic policy role at the White House. But the White House has faced setbacks in its push to rein in the power of technology giants. Last month, a federal judge threw out an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook brought by the F.T.C. The agency was given 30 days to amend and refile its lawsuit, and on Friday, it asked for a three-week extension, to Aug. 19, which the judge has granted. On Monday, Aon and Willis Towers Watson said they had decided to end the Justice Department\u2019s litigation rather than face a lengthy court battle. \u201cWe reached an impasse with the U.S. Department of Justice,\u201d Aon\u2019s chief executive, Greg Case, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a victory for competition and for American businesses, and ultimately, for their customers, employees and retirees across the country,\u201d Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement. The merger, first proposed in March 2020, faced scrutiny from regulators around the world. Some, including officials in the European Union, granted conditional approval based on various concessions and divestments. But the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit was not scheduled to head to trial until at least November, which would have postponed the deal until the first quarter of 2022 at the earliest, a delay that was untenable for Aon, a company spokesman told The New York Times. The government\u2019s complaint argued that the combined companies would \u201celiminate substantial head-to-head competition and likely lead to higher prices and less innovation.\u201d It said the companies dominated markets for risk and reinsurance brokering, health and pension benefits brokering, actuarial services for employer benefit programs and private exchanges that offer retiree benefits. The government said previously that the companies were aware they already operated in an oligopoly. \u201cIf permitted to merge, Aon and Willis Towers Watson could use their increased leverage to raise prices and reduce the quality of products relied on by thousands of American businesses \u2014 and their customers, employees and retirees,\u201d the Department of Justice wrote last month. Aon argued that the government misunderstood its businesses. \u201cWe are confident that the combination would have accelerated our shared ability to innovate on behalf of clients, but the inability to secure an expedited resolution of the litigation brought us to this point,\u201d Mr. Case said in the statement. The decision to abandon the deal \u201chighlights one of the possible implications of more aggressive enforcement\u201d as Mr. Biden makes good on campaign promises to be tough on companies, said A. Douglas Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University and former acting chief of the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division. The F.T.C. and the Justice Department are likely to look for ways to have an impact without being subject to judicial review, Mr. Melamed said, and one way to do that is by challenging mergers in general, whether or not a case has a good chance of winning. \u201cThe risk and time delays of a merger challenge often cause the parties to abandon a deal even if the government\u2019s case is weak,\u201d he said. The decision to block the merger sends a clear signal that the White House is willing to take a stronger stand on competition than the Trump administration, which reviewed the deal but did not take steps to fight it. The firm stance also involves more trans-Atlantic cooperation between American and European regulators. For instance, after the European Union in April challenged the $8 billion merger of the life sciences companies Illumina and Grail, the F.T.C. announced that it was dropping a request in federal court to block the deal, a strategy that helps preserve agency resources. And European antitrust officials have said they expect more cooperation as the two governments\u2019 perspectives increasingly align. With the merger between the insurance brokers terminated, a slew of contingent deals will be called off, too. Some of the regulatory approvals that the combined companies received, for example in South Africa and the European Union, were dependent on Aon and Willis getting rid of some business units. Aon said it would pay a $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson. Both companies are incorporated in Ireland and have headquarters in London. Aon, which reported revenue of more than $11 billion last year, has around 50,000 employees around the world and more 100 offices in the United States. Willis Towers Watson employs about 45,000 people globally, with more than 80 offices in the United States. It reported revenue of more than $9 billion in 2020.\n\nA Beijing outlet of New Oriental Education and Technology, an educational services firm. Many middle-class families in China pay for after-school tutoring to help their children gain an edge in national tests. Chinese regulators barred tutoring companies from making profits, a move that sent their shares plummeting on Monday, erasing tens of billions of dollars from the value of the country\u2019s once blistering education sector, as Beijing turns its focus to the growing financial burden that students \u2014 and their parents \u2014 face. Some of China\u2019s biggest publicly listed education companies lost significant chunks of their value as investors ditched them after the announcement of rules that require all companies that offer curriculum tutoring to register as nonprofit institutions. The rules, which were published over the weekend, will also restrict new foreign investment, once a key avenue for those companies to raise money. They are the latest in a series of moves by China to rein in its technology sector that has hit stocks of its biggest companies, in sectors as diverse as ride hailing and music licensing. Regulators say they are tackling privacy, cybersecurity and antitrust concerns, directing their crackdown at the country\u2019s thriving internet industry. Koolearn Technology, which provides online classes and test-preparation courses, said it expected the rules to \u201chave material adverse impact\u201d on its business. Its stock lost 33 percent on Monday. A handful of other Hong Kong-listed education companies, including New Oriental Education & Technology and Scholar Education Group, along with the U.S.-listed companies Gaotu Techedu and TAL, issued similar statements. For years, China\u2019s private education sector was one of the most enticing for global investors, who threw billions of dollars at publicly listed companies that promised to capitalize on the hundreds of thousands of families striving for better opportunities through education. By Monday evening in Asia, much of that money had vanished. Many middle-class families in China pay for after-school tutoring to help their children gain an edge in national tests that determine their futures. Last week, the country\u2019s top administrative body published an opinion that took aim at the sector and outlined its plans to \u201creduce the burden of students\u2019 homework and off-campus training.\u201d Analysts swiftly recalibrated their assessment of the prospects for the industry, which was once valued at more than $100 billion by Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs. On Monday, the bank\u2019s analysts estimated it would be worth $24 billion in the coming years. The news reverberated through Chinese stock indexes. The Shanghai Composite index closed 2.3 percent lower, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 4.1 percent. Separately, regulators over the weekend ordered Tencent, the Chinese tech conglomerate, to end all exclusive music licensing deals with record labels and fined it around $78,000 for what it said were unfair practices. Shares in Tencent Music, which trades in the United States, were also lower on Monday.\n\nThomas Barrack, the former chief executive of Colony Capital, was ordered to post a $250 million bond, one of the highest in history. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the founder and former chief executive of Colony Capital, is set to appear in federal court in New York on Monday to face charges of failing to register as a foreign lobbyist, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators. A judge last week ordered Mr. Barrack, a friend and fund-raiser for former President Donald J. Trump, to post a $250 million bond, one of the highest in history, to secure his limited freedom. The DealBook newsletter asks: How did he raise so much money so quickly? The bond is partly backed by about $150 million in stock in DigitalBridge, as Colony is now known, a Justice Department representative confirmed to DealBook. (That\u2019s about 5 percent of the company\u2019s shares.) Mr. Barrack also offered $5 million in cash, being held by his lawyer, and several properties. Mr. Barrack agreed with DigitalBridge that his stock could not be sold, transferred or encumbered while he\u2019s free on bail. The company declined to comment. That exposes the government to swings in the value of the shares, and possibly ownership in the investment firm. One entity that the government won\u2019t be taking a stake in is Mr. Barrack\u2019s special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which pulled its registration last week. Critics of the cash bail system say that it favors wealthier defendants, keeping poor people in jail awaiting trial and disproportionately affecting Black and Latino defendants. This year, Illinois became the first state to eliminate cash bail, a move that Gov. J.B. Pritzker said was a step toward \u201cdismantling the systemic racism that plagues our communities.\u201d Other states, like California, New Jersey and New York, have limited the use of bail in recent years. Mr. Barrack\u2019s bail, and other high-value bonds that came before it, highlight the disparity. Prosecutors sought $250 million from the junk-bond mogul Michael R. Milken in 1989 (worth well over $500 million in today\u2019s money), but the judge demanded $1 million for his freedom. He posted cash and securities. (He was also required to set aside $700 million for restitution funds if prosecutors won.) During his prosecution in 2008, Bernard L. Madoff couldn\u2019t find the four co-signers required for his $10 million bond, and struck a deal to post properties with just his wife and brother co-signing.\n\nHow the pandemic became \u2018a pot of gold for tech.\u2019 \u201cWe went from being pirates to being the Navy,\u201d said Marc Andreessen. \u201cPeople may love pirates when they\u2019re young and small and scrappy, but nobody likes a Navy that acts like a pirate.\u201d Even as 609,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus and the Delta variant surges, as restaurants and other businesses shut down and as millions of workers found themselves unemployed, the tech industry flourished in the pandemic. The combined stock market valuation of Apple, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook increased by about 70 percent to more than $10 trillion. That is roughly the size of the entire U.S. stock market in 2002. Apple alone has enough cash in its coffers to give $600 to every person in the United States. And in the next week, the big tech companies are expected to report earnings that will eclipse all previous windfalls. Silicon Valley, the world headquarters for tech start-ups, has never seen so much loot, reports The New York Times\u2019s David Streitfeld. More Valley companies went public in 2020 than in 2019, and they raised twice as much money when they did. Forbes calculates there are now 365 billionaires whose fortunes derive from tech, up from 241 before the virus. Tech is triumphant in a way that even its most evangelical leaders couldn\u2019t have predicted. No single industry has ever had such power over American life, dominating how we communicate, shop, learn about the world and seek distraction and joy. \u201cCall it half luck \u2014 being in the right place at the right time \u2014 and half strategic tactics by companies recognizing this was going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cWhat for most industries were hurricane-like headwinds was a pot of gold for tech.\u201d But any measures restricting tech will need public sentiment behind them to succeed. Even some of tech\u2019s biggest supporters see the potential for worry here. \u201cWe went from being pirates to being the Navy,\u201d Marc Andreessen, a central figure in Silicon Valley for a quarter-century, told the Substack writer Noah Smith in a recent interview. \u201cPeople may love pirates when they\u2019re young and small and scrappy, but nobody likes a Navy that acts like a pirate. And today\u2019s technology industry can come across a lot like a Navy that acts like a pirate.\u201d",

            "content": "Montgomery: A downtown street festival Saturday in front of Troy University\u2019s Rosa Parks Museum will celebrate Juneteenth with food, songs and reflection. The holiday, gaining more widespread recognition in recent years but long been marked in Black communities, observes the end of slavery in the U.S. \u201cOur goal is to commemorate Juneteenth by celebrating African American freedom with a focus on education and achievement,\u201d said Donna Beisel, assistant director and K-12 coordinator for the museum. Comedienne JOY is Saturday\u2019s emcee, with the band Souled Out Groove as the headline act. Guests will be able to register to vote on site, Beisel said. Past participants have been \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d excited to return to an in-person event this year, she said. The Rosa Parks Museum is kicking off Juneteenth on Thursday evening with a panel discussion on \u201cMontgomery Then and Now,\u201d offering perspectives on how the city\u2019s past is dictating its future, the role of public protests, and how millennials can influence the change. The museum is also partnering with PBS\u2019 \u201cFrontline\u201d for the Un(re)solved AR installation, which will be on display in the museum\u2019s gallery through Saturday. The multiplatform experience examines a federal effort to investigate more than 150 cold case murders related to racism.\n\nJuneau: City leaders have declined a $2 million donation from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. amid concerns from some Assembly members about the public perception of accepting the money. The company, which operates Norwegian Cruise Line, last month announced plans to donate $10 million total to Alaska port communities with tourist economies hit hard by the lack of cruise ship passengers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has purchased an empty waterfront lot in Juneau, where it wants to build a dock, KTOO Public Media reports. City and Borough of Juneau Assembly Member Carole Triem cited the proposed dock as factoring heavily in her decision to vote against accepting the money. \u201cI just think that to accept money from NCL, even though it\u2019s totally separate from the decisions we\u2019d be making about this development project, just is not a good look for us,\u201d she said. Assembly member Wade Bryson said the path for the company getting a dock is already charted out. He said rejecting the donation would be \u201cfoolish and fiscally irresponsible.\u201d The Assembly asked the city manager to suggest to the company donating the $2 million directly to an organization instead of the city.\n\nPhoenix: Maricopa County public health officials are redoubling their efforts to boost COVID-19 vaccination rates by using detailed population data to identify communities with barriers to getting vaccinated. Arizona\u2019s most populous county on Wednesday launched a new data dashboard displaying vaccine data across ZIP codes with breakdowns by demographics like sex, age group, race and ethnicity, though getting good data on vaccine uptake among the county\u2019s Hispanic/Latino community remains a challenge. The public release of the upgraded ZIP code dashboard coincides with a countywide promotional campaign targeted at residents who are still on the fence about getting a COVID-19 shot. Health officials believe there are many residents who are willing to get inoculated but haven\u2019t yet, meaning either the vaccine needs to be more easily accessible to them, or they have unanswered questions about it. The goal is to home in on communities that have faced challenges getting vaccinated so that health officials can target vaccine pop-up events and messaging in certain areas to meet needs. The data has led, for example, to vaccine event partnerships with groups like the Arizona Korean Nurses Association and various refugee resettlement organizations.\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday allowed part of a lawsuit over the state\u2019s ongoing control of the Little Rock School District to proceed. Justices dismissed part of the lawsuit parents filed challenging the state\u2019s decision to place limits on the Little Rock School Board when the district was returned to local control. The state took over the district in 2015 because of lagging test scores. The Arkansas Board of Education voted in 2019 to return the district to the control of a new school board that was elected last year. But the state placed limits on the board\u2019s authority, including preventing it from recognizing the local teachers union as a bargaining agent. Justices on Thursday said the part of the case challenging the state laws the board used to place the limits on the district\u2019s local control can move forward. The local teachers union went on a one-day strike in 2019 over the state\u2019s control of the district and educators\u2019 loss of collective bargaining rights.\n\nLos Angeles: The state\u2019s power grid operator called for voluntary energy conservation Thursday as the Golden State sweltered under a heat wave that has blanketed the West and brought dangerously high temperatures to many areas. The California Independent System Operator issued a Flex Alert urging people to set their thermostats to 78 degrees or higher and avoid using washing machines, dishwashers and other major appliances. While the electrical supply was tight, CEO Elliot Mainzer said actual blackouts were unlikely. But he said that could change as temperatures spiked and urged people to heed the Flex Alert. \u201cCalifornians have stepped up many times before when asked to pitch in, and I\u2019m confident they will do so,\u201d Mainzer said. During another heat spell last August, the state saw two days of rotating power outages that affected more than 200,000 people. They were the first such blackouts since 2001. Power officials said the electrical grid has seen upgrades in power storage and transmission since then, including adding about 3,500 megawatts of capacity \u2013 in general enough to power some 2.6 million homes. That includes 2,000 megawatts worth of battery storage that could be crucial when solar power generation tails off after dark.\n\nDenver: A baker who won a partial victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 for refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple violated the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law by refusing to make a birthday cake for a transgender woman, a state judge has ruled. In Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Denver District Judge A. Bruce Jones said Autumn Scardina was denied a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside to celebrate her gender transition on her birthday because of her transgender status in violation of the law. While Jack Phillips said he could not make the cake because of its message, Jones said the case was about a refusal to sell a product, not compelled speech. He pointed out that Phillips testified during a trial in March that he did not think someone could change their gender, and he would not celebrate \u201csomebody who thinks that they can.\u201d \u201cThe anti-discrimination laws are intended to ensure that members of our society who have historically been treated unfairly, who have been deprived of even the every-day right to access businesses to buy products, are no longer treated as \u2018others,\u2019 \u201d Jones wrote. The group representing Phillips, Alliance Defending Freedom, said Wednesday that it would appeal the ruling, which ordered him to pay a $500 fine.\n\nNew London: The easing of the pandemic has brought an increase in families seeking mental health aid for children suffering the effects of being isolated from their peers. A Norwich woman whose 9-year-old son was experiencing fits of rage contacted her pediatrician, who reached out to a medical center only to discover that it was overwhelmed with patients awaiting inpatient care. \u201cRight then there were 30 patients, ages 7 and up, who were waiting for inpatient care,\u201d Dr. Richard Lavoie told The Day. \u201cThey were staying in hallways, sitting on stretchers and in community rooms, waiting to be placed somewhere.\u201d A poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association and released last month found 48% of adults surveyed said the pandemic has caused mental health problems for one or more of their children, and about a quarter said they had sought professional mental health help for their children because of the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s about being separated from their peers,\u201d Carrie Pichie, a clinical psychologist and a regional director of ambulatory services for Hartford HealthCare\u2019s Behavioral Health Network, told the newspaper. \u201cEarly in the pandemic, not being in school and not being able to participate in sports and other extracurriculars was devastating for many kids. Some find it difficult to reintegrate.\u201d\n\nDover: The state Senate voted mostly along party lines Tuesday to give final approval to two Democratic proposals further restricting gun ownership in Delaware. The first measure prohibits the purchase or possession of a firearm by anyone who knows they are the subject of a protection-from-abuse order. The purchase prohibition also applies to anyone who knows they are the subject of an arrest warrant or indictment for any felony or any misdemeanor domestic violence charge. The second bill outlaws so-called ghost guns that can\u2019t be traced by law enforcement officials because they don\u2019t have serial numbers. The bill, similar to a measure that failed to get a floor vote last year, makes it a felony to possess or manufacture an untraceable, undetectable or covert firearm. Anyone who already possesses an unfinished firearm frame or receiver \u2013 a component of a gun that houses the firing mechanism \u2013 with no serial number would have 90 days to comply with the law, presumably by destroying or surrendering it.\n\nWashington: An inmate of the D.C. Jail has been elected to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, the most local form of government within the nation\u2019s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Joel Caston, 44, asked to be heard not as a teenager convicted of murder in the \u201990s but as an author, mentor and man moving forward. \u201cI feel presidential,\u201d Caston said from inside the jail Wednesday. \u201cI feel like the president, a public servant who can deliver.\u201d The seat he won \u2013 a district east of Capitol Hill encompassing the jail, Harriet Tubman Women\u2019s Shelter, and new, as-yet sparsely population luxury apartments near the Stadium-Armory Metro station \u2013 has never before been filled, which voting activists attribute to the transitory nature of the jail and the shelter\u2019s population. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019m gonna do is listen,\u201d Caston said, describing how he hopes to learn from fellow commissioners during his first ANC meeting. \u201cI think the main thing missing from these conversations is our humanity. Often times when we are incarcerated, we can lose the sense of a person\u2019s identity.\u201d The D.C. native is equipped with a tablet to attend meetings and email to reach his roughly 1,500 new constituents. A local election statute signed into law late last year by Mayor Muriel Bowser allows incarcerated felons to cast ballots.\n\nTallahassee: Plumes of toxic oceanic bacteria known as red tide have been moving up the western Florida coast, strewing thousands of dead fish on beaches, while state officials tried to reassure Floridians and potential tourists Thursday that the outbreak is being taken seriously but isn\u2019t as bad as it would seem. Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday assembled a team of experts in St. Petersburg to describe the work that is underway to better understand and control the latest outbreak. As the state\u2019s economy continues to emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, images of beaches littered with dead fish could threaten to keep visitors from flocking to seaside communities during the July 4 holiday. The governor said it was important to let \u201cfolks know that these places are open.\u201d \u201cThe hotels, the restaurants, the beaches are open,\u201d he said. Three years ago, massive blooms of the red tide prompted some beaches to close. The outbreak killed tons of aquatic life, littering coastlines with rotting fish and keeping people off the sand and water. Much of the current outbreak of the red tide bacteria, Karenia brevis, is centered in the Tampa Bay area. Even low concentrations have the potential for killing fish. Higher concentrations could affect some people if they swim in the water or eat contaminated shellfish, including oysters.\n\nAtlanta: Police had no justification for pulling two students from their car and hitting them with stun guns while they were stuck in traffic caused by protests over George Floyd\u2019s death, a lawsuit filed Thursday says. The federal lawsuit by Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young \u2013 students at historically Black colleges in Atlanta \u2013 accuses police of assault and false arrest and says one officer dangerously escalated the confrontation by falsely claiming the pair had a gun. \u201cAccountability is what relieves pain and brings peace, and unfortunately there has been no accountability,\u201d said Mawuli Mel Davis, an attorney for Young. The suit names the city, nine officers and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms as defendants. The mayor\u2019s office said it had not been served with the lawsuit and could not comment. Video of the May 2020 confrontation \u2013 shared widely online \u2013 shows officers shouting at Pilgrim and Young, firing Tasers at them and dragging them from the car. The pair can be heard screaming and asking what they did wrong. They were heading home May 30 during a curfew declared hours earlier by Bottoms when an officer instructed Young, 23, to leave the area, according to the suit. Unaware of the curfew, Young moved forward a few yards to comply with the officer but was again stuck in traffic, the suit says.\n\nHonolulu: The state has loosened some of its pandemic travel rules. The change is expected to drive more tourism to Hawaii and between the islands this summer, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. People can now fly between islands in the state without having to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested for the coronavirus. The new rules began Tuesday. \u201cIt was so easy compared to when I went to Alabama and I had to look for my health code. They don\u2019t need it anymore for Hilo,\u201d Big Island resident Fabinita Franco said before leaving Oahu\u2019s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport after a work trip. \u201cI come from the Philippines, and I don\u2019t have much knowledge of computers. I\u2019m more confident to travel now. I was nervous before.\u201d Anyone who has been vaccinated in Hawaii can also now travel from the U.S. mainland without having to be tested. Unvaccinated travelers and people vaccinated outside Hawaii must still get a negative coronavirus test before arrival to avoid a 10-day quarantine. Sherilyn Kajiwara, a special-projects administrator assigned to the state\u2019s \u201cSafe Travels\u201d program, said some travelers are still failing to get the proper test, and others believe their vaccination status will allow them to bypass quarantine rules. On Tuesday, 1,693 people were in travel quarantine in Hawaii.\n\nMoscow: The Idaho State Board of Education says higher education institutions no longer have to require entrance exams for admissions. The board formally approved the change during a meeting Wednesday, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports. TJ Bliss, the board\u2019s chief academic officer, said the plan was developed in collaboration with state universities and their presidents. State universities and colleges can still require entrance exams if they choose, but the statewide requirement is gone. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of research suggesting that college entrance exam scores don\u2019t predict success and that (grade-point average) and other factors are more important, and our institutions have recognized that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a national movement away from college entrance exams, so another compelling argument is competition.\u201d Idaho Superintendent of Public Schools Sherri Ybarra said high school students are still required to take some form of college entrance exam before they can graduate. But board member Debbie Critchfield noted the change would remove a barrier for some would-be college students. \u201cWe want to remove barriers, but we also believe in standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that our students don\u2019t remove themselves from going to college because of a policy that doesn\u2019t fit right this minute.\u201d\n\nChicago: Two of the city\u2019s institutions of higher education have received donations from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott \u2013 the largest gifts from a single person in their histories, officials said Tuesday. Kennedy-King College, a branch of City Colleges of Chicago, was given $5 million by Scott. The University of Illinois-Chicago received $40 million from the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. \u201cMs. Scott\u2019s extremely generous donation will advance the lives of students who are poised to make great contributions to our city, our state and our world,\u201d UIC Chancellor Michael D. Amiridis said. \u201cHer gift is a vote of confidence in the mission of public higher education and in UIC.\u201d Scott has donated $2.7 billion to 286 organizations. Forbes Magazine has reported Kennedy-King College, which serves a largely African American student body, is considered one of the top 10 community colleges in the country as determined by rankings site Academic Influence. \u201cWe are dedicated to realizing the full potential of each one of our talented students,\u201d said Kennedy-King College President Greg A. Thomas. Located in Chicago\u2019s South Side Englewood neighborhood, Kennedy-King serves nearly 5,000 students, offering culinary and hospitality, construction technology and creative arts classes.\n\nIndianapolis: Fishers and Noblesville have joined Indianapolis and other cities in rejecting potential payments from several pending state lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors. The cities said they stand to see more cash from their own lawsuits. If they continue as part of the state attorney general\u2019s suits, they have to drop those other legal actions. \u201cWe would not be able to recover that money from the several lawsuits we\u2019ve filed on our own,\u201d said Noblesville city attorney Lindsey Bennett. \u201cAnd it is unlikely we would recover as much money in the state\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d About half the cities and counties in Indiana have filed lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, distributors and dispensers, seeking to recover funds they\u2019ve spent on police, fire, treatment programs and prevention. A state law signed by Gov. Eric Holcomb this year requires cities and counties that want to pursue their own legal action to \u201copt out\u201d of the attorney general\u2019s lawsuit by June 30. Fishers and Noblesville have decided to do so \u2013 for now. They will still have 60 days to rejoin if city officials change their minds.\n\nDes Moines: The state is ending its coronavirus testing program next month, saying demand has fallen at the state-funded drive-thru and clinic sites. \u201cDemand for testing is at its lowest levels in more than a year since vaccine is now widely available and virus activity has significantly decreased,\u201d Iowa Department of Public Health spokeswoman Sarah Ekstrand said in a statement. She said Iowa is finalizing plans to provide at-home test kits free to residents once the state sites close July 16. Health care providers, pharmacies and other retail testing sites will continue to offer tests, Ekstrand said. In recent weeks Gov. Kim Reynolds has signaled to residents that it\u2019s time to return to normal as virus transmission is low, although the state still posts new deaths weekly. As of Wednesday, 6,109 Iowans had died. Some people are resistant to COVID-19 vaccines, and Fort Dodge infectious disease physician Dr. Megan Srinivas said she\u2019s concerned state actions have signaled to residents that the pandemic is over. \u201cWe have several community-based partners that have testing available and more easily accessible than the very limited Test Iowa sites, which is great. However, we need to ensure people realize that these options are there and that testing and pandemic precautions are still extremely critical until we have a much higher vaccination rate,\u201d she said.\n\nTopeka: Residents are using the public-share Bird scooters to make vulgar graffiti. The tires of the scooters can make skidmarks, and some riders are using them to draw penises on Topeka sidewalks \u2013 and doing it at a level that the company hasn\u2019t seen elsewhere. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen that in other markets,\u201d said Adam Davis, government partnership manager for Bird. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know why somebody would find entertainment in destructing property like that.\u201d Non-skid wheels can prevent that vandalism, but Davis said a microchip shortage has more than 50,000 scooters on backorder. Bird is working with a local power-wash company as a short-term solution to the graffiti problems. Davis spoke to the Topeka City Council on Tuesday night to propose long-term solutions addressing concerns raised by members of the governing body. Aside from skidmarks, Topekans and council members alike have complained about scooters blocking sidewalks or being driven recklessly. Bird is preventing rides after 11 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays downtown, limiting speeds there to 10 mph, geofencing high-skidmark areas to slow scooters to 0 mph when in that area, requiring downtown riders to scan driver\u2019s licenses to prove they are 18 or older, and working with police to address problematic riders.\n\nLouisville: Much of the state\u2019s agriculture was built on the backs of Black Americans, yet Black farmers account for less than 600 of the more than 76,000 agriculture operations in Kentucky \u2013 a mere 1.4%. In an effort to increase diversity in agriculture, Farm Credit Mid-America is partnering with Black Soil KY to support a variety of agricultural education and diversity initiatives across the commonwealth, including in places like west Louisville, Lexington and Hopkinsville. The new partnership comes with a commitment from Farm Credit Mid-America to donate $200,000 to Black Soil KY. The investment will be paid out over four years. Black Soil KY is an award-winning agribusiness whose mission is to reconnect Black Kentuckians to their legacy and heritage in agriculture. The organization promotes things like self-sufficiency and encouraging healthy living. It also offers programming dedicated to education, economic development and empowerment for Black Kentuckians. The investment and partnership will help Black farmers like Edward Hickerson, from Henderson, who owns Hickerson Veggies LLC. A veteran who served in Iraq, Hickerson uses farming as part of his healing experience. \u201cIt\u2019s truly making me a better person, and it brings out the very best of me,\u201d he said.\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has agreed to turn off federal pandemic unemployment payments at the end of July in exchange for a long-term, modest boost to the state\u2019s jobless benefits, announcing Wednesday that he\u2019s signed a bill that makes the trade. Republican lawmakers and business organizations agreed to support a $28 increase in Louisiana\u2019s maximum weekly unemployment benefits \u2013 increasing the payment to a top rate of $275 a week \u2013 starting in January. But they added a provision into the legislation that only allowed the benefit hike to take effect if the Democratic governor ended the $300 supplemental federal pandemic unemployment benefit by July 31, weeks earlier than required. Edwards took the deal, becoming one of the first Democratic governors to announce he\u2019ll end the pandemic relief aid weeks ahead of its expiration. After the legislative session wrapped up Thursday, the governor said he already had been weighing shutting down the extra federal benefits in August, ahead of the Sept. 6 federal expiration date. \u201cThe 31st of July doesn\u2019t seem like a bad compromise,\u201d he said last week. Edwards said he was trying to find a \u201creasonable balance\u201d between helping the jobless and assisting businesses that say they\u2019re having trouble finding people to fill their employee ranks.\n\nPortland: The state is offering a cash prize of more than $875,000 to try to convince more residentste to get vaccinated against COVID-19. More than 56% of the state\u2019s total population is fully vaccinated \u2013 one of the highest percentages in the country. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday that the state will hold a drawing to give one vaccinated person $1 for every person vaccinated in Maine by July 4. The winner would get $876,655 if the drawing took place the day it was announced. \u201cWe know the best way to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our communities is to get vaccinated,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWe want to beat out Vermont; we want to beat out Connecticut \u2013 New England sibling rivalry.\u201d The state is accepting registrations for the drawing until the end of the day June 30. The state plans to announce the winner July 4. Hundreds had already signed upby Thursday. Mills said the sweepstakes is intended to help the nation meet President Joe Biden\u2019s goal of getting at least one shot of vaccine to 70% of American adults by July 4. She said the drawing is open to everyone 12 and older who has received at least one dose.\n\nOcean City: The OC Air Show is returning this weekend, bringing the sounds of sonic booms, dazzling aerobatic maneuvers and high-speed passes to the beach resort. The air show draws thousands of spectators and aviation enthusiasts to Ocean City each summer as various military aircraft, stunt pilots and other acts gather to entertain onlookers. This year marks a return to a more traditional OC Air Show format after event organizers had to overhaul last year\u2019s show because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds \u2013 a six-jet demonstration team that executes precise, aerobatic maneuvers at more than 1,000 mph with F-16 Fighting Falcons \u2013 will mark the conclusion of the air show this year, performing delta formation. Also on display at this weekend\u2019s show will be the F-22 Raptor, one of the fastest, most maneuverable fighter jets around. The jet\u2019s design and twin engines allow it to reach \u201csupercruise\u201d at 1.5 times the speed of sound without using its afterburners. The F-22 Raptor\u2019s demo team will put the jet\u2019s maneuverability on display, including one stunt in which they execute a somersault in midair. The pilots will take the plane into a straight-up vertical climb before reserving the jet back down and lifting its nose before it hits the ocean, all while using near zero forward speed.\n\nBoston: Some pandemic-era policies that had expired Tuesday \u2013 such as allowing restaurants to offer takeout cocktails \u2013 were quickly extended Wednesday after Republican Gov. Charlie Baker signed a bill approved by state lawmakers. The new law would also let government bodies continue to hold virtual public hearings and extend some protections for tenants facing eviction. Those protections briefly expired after the coronavirus state of emergency, which had been in place for more than a year, was lifted in Massachusetts. The new law would also extend hardship protections to those facing eviction by continuing the court practice of offering temporary continuances to tenants who have filed applications for rental assistance, thereby preventing evictions in cases in which tenants are unable to pay rent due to COVID-19-related financial hardship until April 2022. And the law includes provisions intended to help tenants facing possible eviction understand their legal options. Restaurants, which were among those businesses hardest-hit during the pandemic, would be allowed to continue offering expanded outdoor dining through April of next year. And takeout cocktails would have to be sold at the same price as drinks that are consumed at the restaurant.\n\nLansing: The state will lift all indoor capacity restrictions and mask requirements next week, 10 days sooner than planned, amid vaccinations and plummeting COVID-19 infections, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Thursday. The state\u2019s main coronavirus order will expire at the end of Monday instead of July 1, bringing to an end 50% occupancy limits inside restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues and at indoor events like weddings and funerals. The move came days after California and New York lifted most of their remaining restrictions, joining other states in opening the way, step by step, for what could a close-to-normal summer. \u201cToday is a day that we have all been looking forward to, as we can safely get back to normal day-to-day activities and put this pandemic behind us,\u201d Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement issued 15 months after she first signed emergency orders to control the coronavirus. \u201cWe owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the medical experts and health professionals who stood on the front lines to keep us all safe.\u201d About 4.9 million Michiganders 16 and older, or 60% of those residents, have gotten at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.\n\nSt. Paul: The state has reached 3 million residents who\u2019ve had at least one COVID-19 shot, health officials said Wednesday. The state Department of Health said 3,005,706 Minnesotans had received at least their first dose as of Monday, while 2,774,889 had completed the series. The department logged 5,979 new vaccinations Monday. The 3 million milestone came as the state\u2019s other coronavirus metrics continued to improve as well. The department reported fewer than 100 new cases both Tuesday and Wednesday \u2013 the first time those numbers have been so low since April 2020. \u201cOur COVID-19 numbers are at their lowest since the earliest days of the pandemic and life is getting back to normal because Minnesotans rolled up their sleeves and the vaccines work,\u201d Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. He urged Minnesotans to take advantage of incentives such as free drinks being offered by some establishments, community vaccination events, and free or discounted rides to vaccine appointments via Uber and Lyft. The department said 66% of Minnesotans 16 and older and 90% of those 65 and older have now had at least one dose, though the pace has slowed in recent weeks.\n\nJackson: A prominent business leader said Wednesday that the decision to change the state\u2019s flag has removed a \u201csignificant impediment\u201d to economic development in Mississippi. Lawmakers voted last year to retire a Confederate-themed state flag as part of the national reckoning over racial injustice. \u201cThis, I think, removes a significant impediment and will change perceptions of Mississippi across this country and across the world,\u201d said Anthony Wilson, 2020-21 Mississippi Economic Council chair, at the council\u2019s annual meeting in Jackson. The Mississippi Economic Council was a staunch supporter of the Legislature\u2019s decision to surrender the last state banner in the U.S. that included the Confederate battle emblem \u2013 a red field topped by a blue X with 13 white stars. The rebel flag has been used by Ku Klux Klan groups and is widely condemned as racist. During the November 2020 election, voters approved the new state flag with a magnolia and the phrase \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d That flag was officially adopted by the Legislature this year. The flag was displayed prominently at the in-person event at the Jackson Convention Complex, which drew hundreds of business leaders from across the state. Dozens of small state flags lined a red carpet in front of a stage and podium, behind which was displayed another massive state flag.\n\nO\u2019Fallon: A swath of southern Missouri is seeing a big rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations at just the wrong time, as tourists eager to get out after being cooped up for a year make their way to popular destinations such as Branson and Lake of the Ozarks. Data from the state health department\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard Wednesday showed 206 people hospitalized with the virus in southwestern Missouri \u2013 nearly double the 111 hospitalizations from that region at the start of May. The number of people in intensive care units in the region has tripled, from 22 a month and a half ago to 65 now. Meanwhile, statewide hospitalizations have remained steady since March. Health experts cite two factors driving the surge: the presence of the faster-spreading Delta variant and a reluctance among residents to get vaccinated. While 52.6% of Americans have initiated vaccination, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most southern Missouri counties are well short of 40%. Branson sits in Taney and Stone counties, where the vaccination rates as of Wednesday were 27.4% and 28.4%, respectively. Miller County, at Lake of the Ozarks, had a vaccination rate of 22.9%. \u201cWe think that with the Delta variant here, those that aren\u2019t vaccinated are just sitting ducks,\u201d said Steve Edwards, CEO of CoxHealth.\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Wednesday that he will contribute his salary from the first quarter of 2021 to a Hardin facility treating substance abuse in southeast Montana. Gianforte, a multimillionaire, said last year that he would donate his entire governor\u2019s salary \u2013 roughly $120,000 annually \u2013 to various philanthropies in the state. One Health Bighorn, a federally qualified health center, is the first to receive a portion of the governor\u2019s salary. The facility provides a variety of medical services, including substance abuse treatment. \u201cWe face a drug epidemic in our state, and while there\u2019s no silver bullet to end it, we can combat it by promoting treatment and recovery for Montanans struggling with addiction,\u201d Gianforte said in a statement. The contribution will be used to support the facility\u2019s peer support program as well as medication-assisted treatment for individuals with opioid and meth use disorders, according to a statement from the governor\u2019s office. Gianforte has prioritized combatting drug addiction since assuming office in January, establishing a new fund to support substance abuse prevention and treatment programs across the state.\n\nLincoln: State offices will close Friday amid a new federal law establishing Juneteenth as a recognized government holiday. Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered the closure to comply with a state law that grants the same paid holiday benefits to state employees. State employees will receive a paid day of leave. Exceptions may include law enforcement, security, military and state employees engaged in other essential functions. The governor\u2019s office said in a press release that all workers should receive official instruction from their agency director or personnel representative. Juneteenth is a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865.\n\nCarson City: A northern Nevada attorney who has questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election and was outside the U.S. Capitol the day it was violently stormed has announced he\u2019s running for governor. Republican Joey Gilbert told an applauding audience at the Ahern Hotel in Las Vegas over the weekend that he planned to challenge Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in Nevada\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial race, according to a video of the event posted on Facebook. Gilbert\u2019s assistant Andrea Wexelblatt confirmed his campaign announcement to the Associated Press. Gilbert, a former professional boxer, said in his remarks Saturday that he believed Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and was \u201cstill our president.\u201d \u201cLet me say this: If election integrity is not the No. 1 issue of these guys running, then they\u2019re either lost, confused or too stupid to be running,\u201d he said, referencing other Republicans who intend to run. He positioned voter fraud allegations at the center of his campaign, falsely claimed COVID-19 vaccines were unproven and urged people not to take them. He also referred to the coronavirus as a \u201cplandemic,\u201d using a term that suggests the pandemic was intentionally created.\n\nExeter: Exeter School District has opened an investigation into the reported use of markers to identify unvaccinated students at a high school prom, just one of multiple issues related to schooling that have sparked condemnation and anger. School administrators running the prom reportedly tagged students\u2019 hands with a marker to identify if they were vaccinated to facilitate contact tracing at the event last month. On Tuesday, parents of Exeter High School students and administrators met at a contentious public forum to talk about the school\u2019s pandemic response, including the contact tracing at prom, mask requirements and critical race theory proposed to be taught in schools. Superintendent David Ryan said at the forum with some 200 attendees that the decision to mark students was \u201cnot a good look.\u201d Board member Travis Thompson said the contact tracing should have been implemented differently but was an essential COVID-19 safeguard. The school said in a statement that the students were notified about the contact tracing before they registered for prom. The contact tracing program was an effort to include all students at prom, regardless of their vaccination status, the school said.\n\nTrenton: The Garden State is the best state in America to live in, according to a recent analysis by the personal finance website WalletHub. The report evaluated states based on five equally weighted categories: affordability, economy, education and health, quality of life, and safety. Of all 50 states, New Jersey placed No. 1 in safety, fifth in education and health and seventh for quality of life. The state did not rank as high in the other two categories: It took 32nd place for its economy and came in second-to-last for affordability. Following New Jersey, the study rated Massachusetts and New York the second- and third-best states to live in, respectively. Idaho and Minnesota rounded out the top five. The total ratings for each state were calculated based on 52 \u201cindicators of livability,\u201d which were then divided among the five broader categories. For example, the report calculated affordability by analyzing cost of living, property taxes, housing affordability, household income and homeownership rates. The report supplemented its numbers with advice from three experts on how states can improve their livability, especially given recent speculation about pandemic-related population shifts.\n\nSanta Fe: A Hispanic fraternal order is suing the mayor over damage to a historical monument by activists last year and the city\u2019s proposal to permanently remove it. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court, the Union Protectiva de Santa Fe argues that the 152-year-old stone obelisk is a legally protected historical site under state law and that its removal dishonors Hispanic veterans. A group of about 40 mostly white activists tore down the stone obelisk last year after other statues and monuments across the U.S. were toppled over concerns about racism. In Santa Fe, inscriptions at the base of the monument honored Union soldiers who died fighting Indigenous tribes and Confederate soldiers. One inscription that described Indigenous people as \u201csavage\u201d was chiseled out in 1974 and never repaired. The lawsuit asks a judge to prevent the city from spending any time or money on modifications to the historic downtown park until the stone obelisk is restored. That would hobble Mayor Alan Webber\u2019s plans to have the monument permanently removed and replaced with something that city officials deem more culturally inclusive. A proposal for a commission to take on that task is being considered by the City Council next month, with an estimated budget of $265,000.\n\nNew York: A bell that rang at some of the most historic moments in American history was taken down and moved Wednesday from a belfry where it survived a blaze last year that gutted a church. New York\u2019s Liberty Bell will be kept temporarily at the New-York Historical Society, displayed as part of an exhibition, according to leadership at Middle Collegiate Church. The Manhattan church was destroyed in December when a fire started in the building next to it and spread, sending flames shooting through its roof. The survival of the bell was gratifying news to the congregation, which has pledged to rebuild. New York\u2019s Liberty Bell has sounded for many milestone moments, such as marking the country\u2019s founding in 1776, as well as presidential inaugurations.\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate pushed a trio of election measures through their chamber Wednesday, including one that would prohibit counting mail-in absentee ballots that aren\u2019t received by local officials by Election Day. But unlike other GOP-led legislatures in battleground states that have passed voting restrictions this year, North Carolina has a Democratic governor who could veto the measures, leaving Republicans powerless to override Gov. Roy Cooper if Democrats continue to stay united in opposition. The measures passed the Senate on a party-line vote and now go to the House, where Republicans also have been weighing absentee changes. Current law allows ballot envelopes postmarked by the day of the election to count if received within a three-day grace period. Although that idea was backed unanimously in separate legislation a dozen years ago, Republicans now say the wait for ballots to trickle in delays the finality of results, and moving up the deadline will help lead to earlier outcomes the public wants. \u201cThe bill will build confidence in our election system,\u201d sponsoring Sen. Warren Daniel, R-Burke County, said during the debate. \u201cEveryone saw how long it took North Carolina to declare winners in the (2020) presidential election and our U.S. Senate election.\u201d\n\nBismarck: Burleigh and Morton counties have joined the city of Mandan in banning the private use of fireworks during the July Fourth holiday season due to the widespread drought in the state. Rural fire chiefs in both counties recommended the bans because of extremely dry conditions. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows more than two-thirds of the state is in extreme and exceptional drought. Morton County officials said setting off fireworks could cause fires \u201cthat could threaten the health, well-being and safety of citizens, and the cost of response may be far in excess of current resources.\u201d If the county receives a significant amount of rain in the coming weeks, it might reassess the ban, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Public or commercial fireworks displays that have received permits from the appropriate agencies are still allowed. Violating the private fireworks ban is a Class B misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail and a $1,500 fine.\n\nColumbus: A downtown Greyhound bus station that has been the scene of hundreds of emergency calls this year alone is a public nuisance, the city and its police department declared in a lawsuit Thursday. City Attorney Zach Klein and the Columbus Division of Police filed the complaint against the bus carrier, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the \u201ccrime-plagued\u201d property. \u201cThe continued violence occurring at this property has plagued our city\u2019s downtown residents, businesses, and visitors for too long,\u201d Klein said in a statement. The lawsuit comes as Columbus police report having received more than 300 calls for service to the bus station so far in 2021, with concerns ranging from narcotics and overdoses to guns, stabbings, and a shooting last month. In four months, there were approximately four overdoses at the station, in addition to about 11 narcotics complaints, the statement said. The police department said the property, located in a highly populated part of downtown, has been on its radar for several years. The public safety concerns also stem from the station being in close proximity to a day care center and a number of restaurants and hotels.\n\nOklahoma City: Thirty-four state lawmakers, including 28 Republicans, called Wednesday for reopening the investigation that led to the conviction of death row inmate Richard Glossip. Republican Rep. Kevin McDugle, a death penalty supporter, said new evidence found by Glossip\u2019s attorney, Don Knight, should prompt another investigation into the 1997 beating death of motel owner Barry Van Treese in Oklahoma City in what prosecutors called a murder-for-hire. Justin Sneed, the man who admitted beating Van Treese to death, was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in return for his testimony that he killed Van Treese after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. In a letter to Gov. Kevin Stitt and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, the lawmakers said new evidence that Sneed framed Glossip to avoid a death penalty could show Glossip is innocent. A spokesperson for Stitt said the letter had not been received. Oklahoma has executed no one since 2015, when three consecutive executions were flawed. Glossip was hours away from execution that year when prison officials realized they received the wrong lethal drug. Separately, lawyers for Glossip and several other death row inmates are challenging the state\u2019s lethal injection protocols in a case in federal court in Oklahoma City.\n\nPortland: With the state and federal eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of June, Oregon lawmakers are hastily working on an amendment to keep financially struggling tenants housed and avoid mass evictions next month. The proposed \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d amendment on Senate Bill 278 would \u201cpause\u201d rental evictions for 60 days for tenants unable to pay their July or August rent if they provide proof to their landlord that they\u2019ve applied for rental assistance through Oregon Housing and Community Services. \u201cWe have had this unequal recession and unequal recovery, and there is still a subset of folks that need a little extra time and help,\u201d Rep. Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, said during a committee meeting Monday. \u201cAnd we have resources, in a magnitude that we have never seen before, to help those folks.\u201d Oregon has had an eviction moratorium in place since April 2020. In addition, last month state lawmakers voted to extend the grace period for past-due rent during the moratorium, allowing tenants to have until Feb. 28, 2022, to pay back rent. But a year into the pandemic, people are still facing financial hardships. In May, 53% of Oregon renters who responded to a survey said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d they would be evicted from their home, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found.\n\nHarrisburg: Former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge suffered a stroke Wednesday, a longtime aide to the former Pennsylvania governor said. Ridge was taken by ambulance from his Bethesda, Maryland, home to a hospital for treatment, spokesman Steve Aaron said. Ridge was conscious upon arrival at the hospital and underwent a procedure that removed a blood clot, Aaron said. He described Ridge as being in critical but stable condition. Ridge, 75, was Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican governor from 1995 to 2001, when he joined the administration of President George W. Bush in the aftermath of 9/11 to become the country\u2019s first homeland security secretary. At the Department of Homeland Security, Ridge headed a sprawling department that was composed of 22 agencies and some 180,000 employees. His efforts there included establishing a system of color-coded terror alerts, and his advocacy for \u201cdisaster kits\u201d in 2003 triggered a run on duct tape and plastic sheeting. More recently he has led Ridge Global, a firm that consults on cyber security, international security and risk management.\n\nProvidence: The state is working on a COVID-19 vaccination incentive program to benefit charities, rather than individuals, Gov. Daniel McKee said Thursday. While some states, including neighboring Massachusetts, are offering a chance to win $1 million lottery prizes and college scholarships to people who get their shots, McKee said he would rather more than a handful of people benefit. \u201cWould you rather give $1 million to one person or spread $1 million out over thousands of people and to help them? And we know that many of the charities have suffered a great deal,\u201d the Democratic governor said at a news conference. \u201cI think the idea is to help as many people as we can.\u201d McKee said under his plan, charities would receive money when the state reaches certain vaccination rate milestones, such as 75%, 80%, 85% and 90%. The total budget for the incentive program would be about $1 million, he said. As of Thursday, almost 607,000 people in the state, or about 56% of the total population, have been fully vaccinated, according to state Department of Health data. About 75% of residents 18 and over are at least partially vaccinated, McKee said. The state is lifting some of its last remaining pandemic-related capacity restrictions Friday, including on nightclubs and live performances.\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked the planned executions of two inmates by electrocution, saying they cannot be put to death until they truly have the choice of a firing squad option set out in the state\u2019s newly revised capital punishment law. The high court halted this month\u2019s scheduled executions of Brad Sigmon and Freddie Owens, writing that corrections officials need to put together a firing squad so that inmates can really choose between that or the electric chair. The state\u2019s plans, the court wrote in an unanimous order, are on hold \u201cdue to the statutory right of inmates to elect the manner of their execution.\u201d The executions were scheduled less than a month after the passage of a new law compelling the condemned to choose between electrocution or a firing squad if lethal injection drugs aren\u2019t available. The statute is aimed at restarting executions after an involuntary 10-year pause that the state attributes to an inability to procure the drugs. Prisons officials previously said they still can\u2019t get hold of lethal injection drugs and have yet to put together a firing squad, leaving the 109-year-old electric chair as the only option.\n\nSioux Falls: The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe is looking for people to help it sell medical marijuana. While cannabis officially becomes legal in South Dakota for medical use in less than three weeks, officials with the state Department of Health say they are still months away from issuing cards to qualifying patients and licenses to prospective cultivators and distributors. But on Native American lands in South Dakota, like the Flandreau Santee Sioux reservation, there\u2019s no need to wait for the state. The tribe, headquartered in Moody County, published job openings for dispensing associates, known in the cannabis industry as \u201cbudtenders,\u201d who will work in both Flandreau and Sioux Falls, according to multiple listings posted online Monday. While the tribe isn\u2019t discussing its cannabis plans publicly, officials indicated during the 2021 legislative session that they were readying to begin marijuana sales this summer. A task force of lawmakers studying marijuana this summer also have a formal invitation from the tribe to tour a cultivation and dispensing facility located on the reservation, and this spring the tribe spent $5 million on premier commercial property in Sioux Falls.\n\nNashville: Some lawmakers are taking aim at the Tennessee Department of Health and the state\u2019s top health official for encouraging minors to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Several Republican lawmakers questioned state Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey during a joint Government Operations Committee meeting Wednesday, lodging complaints and threatening to dissolve or \u201creconstitute\u201d the department\u2019s responsibilities in response to its efforts to vaccinate Tennesseans against the deadly disease. Rep. Scott Cepicky, R-Culleoka, accused the agency of \u201cpeer pressuring\u201d teenagers and young adults to get a vaccine with or without their parents\u2019 permission. At issue are some of the ways the department is encouraging residents to get the vaccine, such as using flyers and advertisements featuring children and phrases like \u201cGive COVID-19 vaccines a shot\u201d or \u201cTennesseans 12+ eligible for vaccines.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the Department of Health is marketing to children, and it looks like you\u2019re advocating,\u201d state Sen. Kerry Roberts, R-Springfield, told Piercey. With only about 35% of residents fully vaccinated, Tennessee has one of the nation\u2019s lowest rates. \u201cI think there is a sense we\u2019re hiding in dark alleys and whispering to kids, \u2018Hey, come get vaccinated,\u2019 \u201d Piercey told lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cWe are not doing that.\u201d\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that he will use $250 million in state money and crowdsourced financing to build more barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico, part of an emerging proposal that also extends his political fight over immigration with Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. But questions remain over how far Abbott can go for a project whose total cost, length and timeline are unclear and could face legal challenges from the federal government. Over a dozen Republican members of the Texas House and Senate joined Abbott for a press conference announcing his intentions to hire a project manager to continue constructing some version of a wall announced last week, echoing former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfinished campaign promise to fortify the southern U.S. border, of which 1,200 miles is in Texas. Abbott also said he is asking the federal government to return land obtained for the wall and return it to private citizens who can allow Texas to finish the job. State Sen. Jane Nelson, chair of the state Senate Finance Committee, said the $250 million in state money \u2013 which Abbott called a down payment \u2013 was being allocated as authorized under emergency orders. A letter released later by Abbott\u2019s office said it would come from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s budget.\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a women\u2019s rights activist from Uganda sued the National Park Service this month after she was decapitated last year by a gate at Arches National Park. The gate had been left unlatched against federal policy for two weeks before it struck Esther Nakajjigo in June 2020, according to the lawsuit filed in Denver. She and her husband were newlyweds traveling in the well-known park when the wind caught the gate as they drove out, Fox13-KSTU in Salt Lake City reports. The lawsuit does not specify the amount of damages being sought, but Nakajjigo\u2019s family has previously filed a $270 million notice of claim. The gate sliced through the side of the couple\u2019s rented car, striking Nakajjigo in the head and neck and killing her, the lawsuit said. Her husband Ludo Michaud witnessed his wife\u2019s death, something he has called the \u201cworst thing I hope I will ever see.\u201d Nakajjigo, 25, was born in Kampala, Uganda, and used her university tuition money to start a nonprofit community health care center for girls and young women when she was a teenager. She earned numerous humanitarian awards and created a popular reality television series aimed at empowering young mothers. She was attending a social-entrepreneurship program in Colorado at the time of her death.\n\nTownshend: A state board on Thursday rejected a proposal to rename a brook that has an outdated, racialized name to the name of a Black woman who was an early settler of the town. But board members expressed a willingness to consider another name or Susanna Toby\u2019s married name, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. The Vermont Board of Libraries responded to a petition asking for Negro Brook, which is located in Townshend State Park, to be renamed after Toby. Renaming the brook after Susanna Toby is controversial because the last name could be considered pejorative, the newspaper reports. Toby has been used as a racial slur, according to testimony at an earlier hearing. One petitioner, Evan Litwin of Burlington, said conversations about name changes are happening all over the United States. \u201cTimes have changed in what folks find acceptable,\u201d Litwin said. \u201cIf one person is offended, and we\u2019re not just talking about one person, then why can\u2019t we just rename the brook to something that isn\u2019t offensive to anyone?\u201d The Board of Libraries has jurisdiction over changing the name of the brook because it is on state land, the newspaper reports. Earlier this month, the town\u2019s Select Board voted to support renaming the brook after Toby but also to bring the question before voters next March.\n\nReston: People should stop feeding birds while scientists determine why hundreds have been blinded and killed in the capital region since late May, a federal agency said. Wildlife managers in Washington, Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia have received an increasing number of reports about sick and dying birds in recent weeks, according to a statement from the U.S. Geological Survey on behalf of conservation groups in the area. The agency said birds have experienced \u201ceye swelling and crusty discharge, as well as neurological signs.\u201d Some have tremors, keep their heads tilted or have trouble balancing, The Washington Post reports. A definitive cause of death has yet to be determined. Birds can transmit diseases to one another when they congregate at feeders and baths. Environmental agencies recommend basic precautions including avoiding the handling of birds but wearing disposable gloves if necessary, keeping pets away from birds, and cleaning feeders with bleach. Megan Kirchgessner, a veterinarian with Virginia\u2019s Department of Wildlife Resources, told the Post that at least 325 reports of sick birds have been collected. She said the condition appears to affect only young blue jays and grackles, not other species or animals.\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday announced a new COVID-19 vaccine incentive lottery for the state\u2019s military, family members and veterans because the federal government wasn\u2019t sharing individual vaccine status of those groups with the state, and there were concerns they would be left out of a previously announced lottery. A lottery that started last week has already had two drawings for $250,000 prizes and also includes giveaways for college tuition assistance, airline tickets and game systems, among other prizes. A final drawing in that lottery will be for a $1 million prize July 13. Washington is among several states that created lotteries in hopes of increasing the pace of vaccination. The governor\u2019s office believes the state is the first with a separate lottery for those who have been vaccinated at military locations. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to say we have found a way to honor our active military duty and our veterans in this regard,\u201d Inslee said. Mike Faulk, a spokesman for Inslee, said the Department of Defense will be involved in circulating a form for military members to fill out. Starting July 20, there will be one drawing a week for three weeks, with cash prizes of $100,000 for the first two weeks and a $250,000 prize for the final week. There will also be $250 Amazon gift cards and $100 state park gift cards up for grabs.\n\nCharleston: The U.S. Department of Justice has slammed a new state law that bans transgender athletes from competing in female sports, asserting in a court filing Thursday that the ban violates federal law. The department filed what is known as a statement of interest in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, its West Virginia chapter and LGBTQ interest group Lambda Legal challenging the ban. The DOJ said the law violates Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity receiving federal funds, as well as the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. \u201cThe United States has a significant interest in ensuring that all students, including students who are transgender, can participate in an educational environment free of unlawful discrimination and that the proper legal standards are applied to claims under Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d the filing said. \u201cA state law that limits or denies a particular class of people\u2019s ability to participate in public, federally funded educational programs and activities solely because their gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth violates both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d the filing said. The West Virginia law \u201cdoes exactly this,\u201d the department said.\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers promised to sign bills banning chokeholds and making other policing changes passed by the Assembly on Wednesday, while also calling on lawmakers to go further to make law enforcement more accountable and transparent. Evers said he would sign four bills that passed with bipartisan support. The Assembly failed to vote on a fifth bill as scheduled that would set a statewide use of force policy for police and extend protections for officers who report abuses. It was stalled due to objections from the Milwaukee police union and despite winning broad bipartisan support in the Senate. The measure was the only one out of a dozen policing measures that failed to pass the Assembly on a day when lawmakers praised bipartisan efforts to address concerns about racial justice and how law enforcement interacts with minority populations. Evers promised to sign the bill that bans chokeholds, except in self-defense, and another measure that requires the reporting of incidents when use of force was used. He also said he would sign measures requiring the posting of use-of-force policies online and creating a community policing grant program.\n\nGillette: Two bats from Devils Tower National Monument have been found with the state\u2019s first confirmed cases of a deadly fungal disease. White-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats in North America since the fungus first appeared in New York in 2006. Testing showed signs of the fungus in bats from southeastern Wyoming in 2018. The recent confirmation at northeastern Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower, the first U.S. national monument, is \u201cdisheartening and frustrating,\u201d park resources management chief Russ Cash said. \u201cBats are such an important piece of our ecosystem and our well-being as humans. Bats devour unbelievable amounts of insects and pests that are a nuisance,\u201d Cash said in a statement Tuesday. The positive test results were no surprise. Biologists confirmed the disease in the Black Hills in South Dakota in 2018 and a dead bat in southeastern Montana\u2019s Fallon County in April, the Gillette News Record reports. The disease has appeared in at least 37 states and seven Canadian provinces. The fungus spreads mainly between bats, but climbers and cavers can spread it too. They should clean and disinfect shoes, clothes and gear before and after visiting bat habitat and avoid reusing potentially exposed items in places free of the fungus, National Park Service officials said.",

The move came days after California and New York lifted most of their remaining restrictions, joining other states in opening the way, step by step, for what could a close-to-normal summer. Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered the closure to comply with a state law that grants the same paid holiday benefits to state employees. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court, the Union Protectiva de Santa Fe argues that the 152-year-old stone obelisk is a legally protected historical site under state law and that its removal dishonors Hispanic veterans.",
