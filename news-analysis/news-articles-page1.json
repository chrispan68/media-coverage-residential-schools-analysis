            "content": "The architect of the Desert View Watchtower, found at the edge of the Grand Canyon, imagined the tower to be a ceremonial space, but also intended it as a way to introduce visitors to the area\u2019s Indigenous cultures.\n\nCultural attractions like theaters and museums took a hit during the pandemic. But for those interested in heritage tourism or Indigenous culture in the United States, immersing yourself can be done safely and simply, outside. With a focus on the outdoors or open-air experiences, these eight parks, heritage centers and exhibits offer fresh opportunities to confront not just the history, but also the present-day realities of Native Americans. Visitors can also meet, listen to and learn from tribal members who are emerging as crucial liaisons in these outdoor spaces. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be working in a time when people want to acknowledge the history,\u201d said Samantha Odegard, a member of the Pezihutazizi Oyate, or Dakota Nation, in Minnesota. As one of 200 Tribal Historic Preservation Officers in the United States, Ms. Odegard, 38, advises federal agencies on how to protect sacred sites in public areas. Native Americans \u201care on every inch of this continent,\u201d Odegard said. \u201cWhatever piece of public land you\u2019re standing on, chances are there\u2019s something there.\u201d\n\nHere are some destinations that spotlight Indigenous culture, from Virginia to California. Of the roughly 300 federal boarding schools built for the purpose of \u201cassimilating\u201d Native American children into Euro-American society, only the buildings of the Stewart Indian School in Carson City, Nev., which operated from 1890 to 1980, remain intact. Its 65 colorful stone buildings \u2014 made by students under the watchful eye of Hopi masons \u2014 are a grim testament to the destructive learning methods that were used here during the earlier part of the school\u2019s years of operation. The site opened as a museum in 2020, but during the pandemic, travelers have been able to do self-guided tours of the campus through an audio feature on their cellphones. To hear recordings of former students and staff describing what life was like inside the walls, visitors need only dial 775-546-1460. \u201cWe definitely had an increase in the number of people doing the trail in 2020,\u201d said Bobbi Rahder, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cParents doing home-schooling would bring their kids out here.\u201d Alumni continue to play an active role in shaping future exhibits, which deal with the intergenerational trauma caused by such facilities. (Free)\n\nTo better supply an Indigenous voice to the history of Nez Perce (Nimiipuu) National Historic Trail, a 1,170-mile route that traces the flight of the Nez Perce tribe in 1877, the Nimiipuu tribal member Stacia Morfin began her own tour company in 2019. Her company, Nez Perce Tourism, offers an itinerary called \u201cHear the Echoes of Our Ancestors,\u201d which involves a daylong boat trip on the Snake River into Hells Canyon, the nation\u2019s deepest gorge. Along the way, Morfin shares traditional Nimiipuu songs, and offers visitors a chance to reflect on their own connection to the land. \u201cWhat matters is that we\u2019re sharing stories from our own perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the last 200 years, the colonial perspective has dominated our society. What we\u2019re trying to do is decolonize these places.\u201d In Buffalo Eddy, an archaeological site 22 miles south of Lewiston, vivid petroglyphs hint at the Nez Perce\u2019s 8,000-year-long tenure of the land, though Morfin believes the timeline is twice as long. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to remind people this is our homeland,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough all the atrocities, we\u2019re still here. We can still share our stories.\u201d (Tours from $150) Approximately 8,000 years ago, Indigenous tribes would gather at the confluence of the Mississippi and St Croix Rivers, near what is now Minneapolis. Today, the site is the Spring Lake Park Preserve, and a haven for cyclists and birdwatchers. The 1,100-acre nature area \u2014 a 20-mile riverfront bike path connects it to St. Paul \u2014 feels like an oasis. Bald eagles, egrets, great blue herons and pelicans use the riverfront as a migration corridor and in the western portion of the park, 150 acres have been restored to tallgrass prairie. The wildflowers in summer are not to be missed. (Next year, a herd of bison will be reintroduced for grazing on the land.) Between picnics under the towering oaks and hiking the 8,000 Year Walk, a quarter-mile trail with interpretive signs, visitors can get a feel for the park\u2019s life cycle. In the years ahead, new trails, a boat launch, and campsites will be added, but not without gaining approval from tribal representatives first. \u201cWe want to accommodate public recreation,\u201d said Lil Leatham, a senior planner with Dakota County Parks, \u201cbut we also want to protect and be good stewards of the Indigenous sites within the park.\u201d (Free)\n\nAt this new public park that opened in eastern Virginia last month, an open-air interpretive center offers a timeline of Indigenous life, from the prehistoric period up to our present day. But a few panels were left blank. \u201cWe left room for the timeline to be added to,\u201d said Tom Smith, the deputy director of operations for the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to present this like a history project.\u201d Rather, the open-ended narrative sends a clear message that, as Smith said, \u201cNative culture is still alive and strong in Virginia.\u201d Machicomoco is Virginia\u2019s first state park specifically focused on Native American culture, and members from the 11 state-recognized tribes weighed in on interpretive themes, signage and even the name (Machicomoco is an Algonquin word meaning \u2018special meeting place\u2019). Set on a quiet stretch of the York River, the park offers scenic hiking trails, a paved bike path and 30 campsites. A canoe and kayak launch is available, too, though workers had to pause construction on it when they began digging up arrowheads and pieces of pottery. \u201cThe first place we picked was actually the same place the Natives used to get in and out of the water,\u201d Smith said, \u201cso we abandoned that site, and chose another location.\u201d (Free) The Desert View Watchtower, a 70-foot stone tower with a circular base that rises dramatically over the south rim of the Grand Canyon, has piqued the interest of travelers since it opened in 1933. Its architect, Mary Colter, modeled it after the Puebloan kivas scattered across the prehistoric Southwest. Back then, Colter imagined it as a ceremonial space, with huge picture windows framing the Painted Desert; it was also intended as a way to introduce visitors to the Indigenous cultures of the area. Nearly a century later, that vision is coming to fruition. In 2017, the tower began hosting Hopi, Navajo, and Zuni artists for jewelry making, weaving, pottery and storytelling events on weekends from May through October. This summer, the series is set to expand, with a packed roster of demonstrators, all taking place outside (check the website for updates about reopening). A dedicated intertribal cultural heritage site, complete with ramada-style huts, picnic areas and a welcome center, is also in the works. \u201cThis has nothing to do with archaeology,\u201d said Janet Balsom, a communications chief at Grand Canyon National Park\u2019s main office. \u201cIt\u2019s about living people and traditions.\u201d Notably, park staff will be hands-off, in order to let Indigenous people take charge of their own storytelling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to our tribal colleagues to be the first voice,\u201d Balsom said. (Free)\n\nYou\u2019ll want to pack your own lunch and drinking water when visiting Ute Mountain Tribal Park, a rugged, stunning archaeological site on Ute Mountain Ute tribal land. \u201cIt\u2019s all primitive,\u201d Veronica Cuthair, the park\u2019s director, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have cafes or anything like that.\u201d Visitors to the austere setting can witness layers of history in the 1,500-year-old cliff dwellings, strewn with pottery shards and bones, and decorated with rock art panels. Full- and half-day tours are led by Ute Mountain Ute tribal members as no self-guided tours are allowed, in part to create much-needed jobs for the community and because the itinerary can be rigorous. To reach the cliff dwellings, nestled deep in the canyons, visitors must embark on a three-mile round-trip hike and climb a series of four ladders. (Sturdy hiking boots are recommended.) Camping is available in Mancos Canyon, home to an array of captivating pictographs; just watch out for the wildlife. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep people on the trails,\u201d Cuthair said, \u201cso they don\u2019t go wandering into the bushes where snakes might be, or badgers, or mountain lions. We have black bears out here, too.\u201d ($30 and $49 per person for half and full-day tours)\n\n\u201cMinnesota history starts at Jeffers Petroglyphs,\u201d said David Briese, a site manager at the southwestern Minnesota park that is home to over 7,000 ancient rock carvings. The earliest petroglyphs date to 5,000 B.C., though some were etched as recently as the mid-1700s, offering valuable clues to the diverse tribes who passed through this landscape. \u201cEver since the last glacier receded and this area opened up, Native Americans have been performing prayers and ceremonies here,\u201d said Briese, noting the significance of showcasing an area marked by Indigenous mastery rather than misfortune. \u201cYou get to tell a positive story about Native American heritage that you don\u2019t normally hear in a museum setting,\u201d he said. The best time to see the carvings is dusk. During the summer, visitors are encouraged to stay for evening tours, where they can veer off the trails and explore the rock face (barefoot, since the site is sacred) themselves. \u201cWhen the sun is at a low angle, it creates these shadows, so the images on the carvings literally pop out from the rock,\u201d Briese said.

Here are some destinations that spotlight Indigenous culture, from Virginia to California. \n\nYou\u2019ll want to pack your own lunch and drinking water when visiting Ute Mountain Tribal Park, a rugged, stunning archaeological site on Ute Mountain Ute tribal land. Visitors to the austere setting can witness layers of history in the 1,500-year-old cliff dwellings, strewn with pottery shards and bones, and decorated with rock art panels. Full- and half-day tours are led by Ute Mountain Ute tribal members as no self-guided tours are allowed, in part to create much-needed jobs for the community and because the itinerary can be rigorous.",

It is a largely ceremonial role although the Queen must approve the appointment after seeking recommendations from the Canadian government.\n\n\"I am inspired by the historic nature of this moment, as our country continues to come to terms with the difficult realities of our collective past,\" , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Monday. \"I know that, as Canada's first Indigenous Governor General, Her Excellency will devote herself to helping us as we confront these difficult truths together, walk the shared path of reconciliation, and build bridges between all those who call our country home.\n\nAs first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) last year, current and former government employees accused Payette of creating a toxic workplace, harassing and bullying employees and reducing some employees to tears.\n\nThe appointment comes at a controversial time in Canada as the country confronts its history of systemic abuse of Indigenous communities, including forced assimilation programs. have recently been found in unmarked graves on the grounds of several former residential schools, leading to widespread outrage and criticism.

Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission reported in 2015 that tens of thousands of indigenous children were neglected and abused in boarding schools they were forced to attend. 182 human remains discovered in unmarked graves near former residential school During her remarks earlier this month, Simon noted that as an Indigenous person, she understands the \"pain and suffering\" felt across the country. \"And as I said in my remarks, we need to stop to fully recognize and memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past that we are learning more about each day,\" Simon said, adding that it took \"courage\" for Trudeau to appoint her to the position. Simon was born in Kangiqsualujjuaq, Nunavik, and has served as an advocate for Inuit rights and culture, according to a Canadian government statement. She was actively involved in negotiations that led to the 1982 patriation of the Canadian Constitution that formally enshrined Aboriginal and treaty rights in the supreme law of Canada. Simon is also a former Canadian ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs, former ambassador to Denmark and past president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national Inuit organization. \"Ms. Simon has dedicated her life to advancing social, economic, and human rights issues for Canadian Inuit and Indigenous peoples, and I am confident that she will serve Canadians and promote our shared values with dedication and integrity,\" Trudeau said in a statement. As Simon takes on the role, she hopes she can be \"a bridge between the different lived realities that together make up the tapestry of Canada.\" \"I can relate to all people no matter where they live, what they hope for or what they need to overcome,\" she said.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA new workshop explores the right of Indigenous people to govern the collection, ownership and use of their biological and cultural data.\n\nWhen Krystal Tsosie introduces her genomics students to the concept of biocommercialism \u2014 the extraction of biological resources from Indigenous communities without benefit \u2014 she always uses the same example: the Human Genome Diversity Project. The researchers who conceived of the project in the 1990s aimed to collect samples from human populations around the world, with particular emphasis on what they deemed \u201cvanishing\u201d Indigenous populations. \u201cA lot of that information is now publicly available to advance the course of science,\u201d said Ms. Tsosie, a genetics researcher at Vanderbilt University and a member of the Navajo Nation. \u201cBut who accesses these data sets?\u201d Ms. Tsosie, answering her own question, cited as examples Ancestry and 23andMe, two companies that commercialize and profit from Indigenous genomic data sourced without consent from people in Central and South America. In 2018, GlaxoSmithKline invested $300 million in 23andMe and paid for a four-year partnership enabling it to use 23andMe\u2019s database of digital sequence information. In 2020, 23andMe licensed a drug compound it developed from its trove of consensually sourced genetic information. Accordingly, Ms. Tsosie helped to organize IndigiData, a four-day remote workshop that took place for the first time in June. The workshop\u2019s core goal was to introduce data science skills to undergraduates and graduates, and the definition of data was expansive, from the genetic sequences of soil microbiomes to traditional worldviews.\n\nThe workshop centered on Indigenous data sovereignty, the idea that nations have the right to govern the collection, ownership and application of their own data. The movement pushes back on a long history of how researchers have taken Native data without permission, often stigmatizing the communities who participated or disregarding their customs surrounding the dead. In one infamous example, an Arizona State University researcher studying the high rates of diabetes in the Havasupai Tribe, who live near the Grand Canyon, gave other researchers access to the samples without the tribe\u2019s consent. When the Havasupai learned of this, they went to court, won their samples back and banished the university from their borders. \u201cWhy are we over here spitting in tubes, giving our genomes away when we know that type of information can be used to make pharmaceutical drugs?\u201d Dr. Fox asked. \u201cWhy not position ourselves so we\u2019re in control of a treasure chest of data?\u201d Ms. Tsosie, one of the leaders of the conference, started her career in cancer biology. But she realized early on that any success she might have developing a cancer therapy drug might never reach her own community. Ms. Tsosie\u2019s father worked for the Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Arizona for 42 years, and she remembered how difficult it was for her tribal community to access specialty services.\n\n\u201cWhat am I doing in cancer biology?\u201d Ms. Tsosie remembered thinking. She switched her academic focus and is now a graduate student in genomics and health disparities. In 2012, Ms. Tsosie met Joseph M. Yracheta, who is of the P\u2019urhepecha and Raramuri peoples, through the Summer Internship for Indigenous Peoples in Genomics, a workshop that trains researchers in genetic science. They started talking about data ethics, and a few years later Matt Anderson, a microbiologist at Ohio State University and a descendant of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, joined the conversation. The organizers recognized that there were limited resources to train Indigenous people how to think about and interpret their data. In January, with funding from the Amgen Foundation and the National Science Foundation, the workshop began to take shape. The participants hail from Indigenous communities across the country and internationally, and have wide-ranging research interests, such as archaeology and pollinators. \u201cWhat ties us together is colonialism,\u201d Dr. Fox said, and laughed. The theme of the inaugural conference was environmental microbiomes, which the organizers felt would resonate with participants. An individual\u2019s microbiomes \u2014 the communities of microorganisms that live inside and on a person \u2014 is deeply intertwined with the surroundings; for instance, the composition of the gut microbiome can be altered by diet as well as air pollution. In recent years, the \u201cvanishing\u201d rhetoric of the Human Genome Diversity Project has shifted to refer to the \u201cvanishing\u201d microbiome of traditional communities, Dr. Anderson said. \u201cExcept instead of people, they\u2019re talking about the microbes associated with people,\u201d Dr. Anderson said. One 2018 article in the journal Science emphasized the need to collect samples from \u201ctraditional peoples in developing countries\u201d in order \u201cto capture and preserve the human microbiota while it still exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cNative DNA is so sought after that people are looking for proxy data, and one of the big proxy data is the microbiome\u201d Mr. Yracheta said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Native person, you have to consider all these variables if you want to protect your people and your culture.\u201d In a presentation at the conference, Joslynn Lee, a member of the Navajo, Laguna Pueblo and Acoma Pueblo Nations and a biochemist at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., spoke about her experience tracking the changes in microbial communities in rivers that experienced a mine wastewater spill in Silverton, Colo. Dr. Lee also offered practical tips on how to plan a microbiome analysis, from collecting a sample to processing it. In a data-science career panel, Rebecca Pollet, a biochemist and a member of the Cherokee Nation, noted how many mainstream pharmaceutical drugs were developed based on the traditional knowledge and plant medicine of Native people. The anti-malarial drug quinine, for example, was developed from the bark of a species of Cinchona trees, which the Quechua people historically used as medicine. Dr. Pollet, who studies the effects of pharmaceutical drugs and traditional food on the gut microbiome, asked: \u201cHow do we honor that traditional knowledge and make up for what\u2019s been covered up?\u201d One participant, the Lakota elder Les Ducheneaux, added that he believed that medicine derived from traditional knowledge wrongly removed the prayers and rituals that would traditionally accompany the treatment, rendering the medicine less effective. \u201cYou constantly have to weigh the scientific part of medicine with the cultural and spiritual part of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Over the course of the IndigiData conference, participants also discussed ways to take charge of their own data to serve their communities. Mason Grimshaw, a data scientist and a board member of Indigenous in A.I., talked about his research with language data on the International Wakashan A.I. Consortium. The consortium, led by an engineer, Michael Running Wolf, is developing an automatic speech recognition A.I. for Wakashan languages, a family of endangered languages spoken among several First Nations communities. The researchers believe automatic speech recognition models can preserve fluency in Wakashan languages and revitalize their use by future generations.\n\nAdditionally, many Indigenous languages are polysynthetic; they do not have fixed vocabularies but rely instead on the recombinations of small building blocks of words. A polysynthetic language like Lakota technically allows there to be infinite words, Mr. Grimshaw said. Indigenous languages often have much less recorded language data to analyze, such as audio files of speakers in conversation, than more common languages do. Mr. Grimshaw sees these complications not as a problem but as a puzzle to be unscrambled. When asked about his wildest data dreams by a participant at the conference, Mr. Grimshaw smiled. \u201cI want a Lakota version of Siri,\u201d he said. IndigiData has funding for the next four years, and the organizers hope that the conference next year will be held in person at the Native BioData Consortium on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. That location, Dr. Anderson noted, is a one-day drive from 13 tribal colleges. Dr. Fox hopes the conference will train the next generation of Indigenous data scientists not just to protect their data but to be empowered by its possibilities. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I like capitalism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut data is power, and that\u2019s the way for us to revitalize our communities.\u201d",

Mason Grimshaw, a data scientist and a board member of Indigenous in A.I., talked about his research with language data on the International Wakashan A.I. Consortium. Dr. Fox hopes the conference will train the next generation of Indigenous data scientists not just to protect their data but to be empowered by its possibilities.",

            "content": "In May 2021, 215 Indigenous children were found buried in an unmarked grave at a Canadian residential school. This moment has catalyzed Canadians to recognize the systematic silencing and displacement of Indigenous people. It is time for all people, including business leaders, to recognize the voice and worldviews of Indigenous people worldwide.\n\nThe discovery of 215 Indigenous children buried in unmarked graves at a residential school in Canada has jolted Canadians. This tragedy is not just a concern for people living in Canada but is symptomatic of the systematic marginalization by Indigenous people worldwide.\n\nFrom the 1880s to as late as 1996, the government of Canada funded programs that forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and put them into church-run residential schools. The children were often ill-treated, and if they died, their families were either not informed or unable to bring their children\u2019s bodies home.\n\nThis treatment of Indigenous people is not exclusive to Canada\u2019s history: it is true of most nations with Indigenous populations and a colonial past, including the U.S., Australia, and South Africa.\n\nBusiness Leaders Have Much to Learn from an Indigenous Worldview\n\nWhat makes this issue tragic even beyond the appalling story it tells about maltreatment and death is that it speaks to the silencing of a worldview that could lead to better business and better societies.\n\nCurrently, the world is facing self-inflicted planetary crises, such as climate change and biodiversity loss. For example, Earth has lost 68% of its wildlife since 1970. But an Indigenous worldview assumes harmony with the land. The lands occupied by Indigenous people, who make up only 5% of the world\u2019s population, contain 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nThe principles that ground an Indigenous worldview can reshape how businesses see themselves and their relationship with the world.\n\nWhat Is an Indigenous Worldview?\n\nTo speak of a single worldview misrepresents Indigenous people as much as it would misrepresent Western businesses. There are many Indigenous worldviews, given there are many Indigenous people. However, there is an aspect of Indigenous thinking that seems to be widely held because of many Indigenous peoples\u2019 connection to the land\u2014from the Native Americans on Tribal lands to the Xhosa of southern Africa.\n\nSpecifically, an Indigenous worldview is relational\u2014from people to things, and even ideas. An Indigenous worldview recognizes that relationships take time to form and generate mutual responsibilities. Business is a part of the natural environment and the community: it does not sit outside of them. To speak of one automatically speaks of the other. Thus, when business harms the community or the environment, it harms itself. Earth is not just a planet: she is \u201cMother Earth,\u201d who gives to and receives from everything she holds.\n\nA relational perspective also applies to time. Past, present, and future are connected. The past and the future shape the present; the present cannot be seen out of the context of the past and future. The concerns of ancestors and future generations are equally important as the concerns of people today.\n\nBy contrast, a Western approach to business often treats people, things and activities as discrete and separated. That is, businesses are separated from each other and society, and transactions are governed by markets and contracts. Business partners negotiate what they give and receive, and value and success is governed by clocks and calendars.\n\nI asked Diane-Laure Arjali\u00e8s, an associate professor of accounting at the Ivey Business School, about her experiences working with Indigenous communities. Arjali\u00e8s is working with an array of partners to develop a Conservation Impact Bond, which is a progressive financial instrument that offers investors returns for conserving the land. A tree, she argues, has value not just when it is cut down but also when it is in the ground, because it helps to maintain biodiversity and ecological resiliency.\n\nThe most challenging part of building this new form of financial instrument is that there is no market that can value resources that remain on the land. The value therefore needs to be negotiated with the people who benefit from the conservation and the investment. These include NGOs, investors, investees, Indigenous people, and researchers.\n\nThis specific bond sought to conserve 150 acres of land in the Carolinian Life Zone in Southwestern Ontario, of which 30 acres is on the traditional territory of the Chippewas of the Thames First Nations (COTTFN). Over the last two centuries, the forest cover in the area had been reduced from 80% to 11% and wetland cover from 28% to 5%. The region is now home to more than 50% of the federally listed species at risk in Canada.\n\nEven though all the partners agreed that conservation was an important goal, they disagreed on a fundamental principle: whether land, water, and species at risk could be priced. And even if they could agree that this type of financialization helped conservation efforts, their opinions of the appropriate price were far apart. The Chippewas of the Thames First Nations saw the importance of all species, which are part of an integrated system with the land and water. One species \u2013 plant or animal \u2014 could not be priced higher than the other, as they were all mutually interdependent. Yet, an inherent principle of pricing requires pricing by value.\n\nRather than trying to simply compromise, the partners agreed on some fundamental principles, grounded in an Indigenous worldview. These included:\n\n1. Consensus-based decision-making. It was important to hear all voices and perspectives. During team meetings, everyone was encouraged to share thoughts and ideas. Much was learned not from the loudest in the room, but often from the quietest.\n\n2. Not everything that is valuable can be measured. Whereas Western approaches to business value \u2018things\u2019, the partners realized that the \u2018flows\u2019 and \u2018connections\u2019 among things were not often seen or valued. An individual species may not seem to hold much value until one sees its critical connections it makes among other species.\n\n3. The importance of storytelling. Vivid stories were often able to change hearts and minds when the numbers and data could not. Stories were able to illustrate ideas that connected people and crossed time. History and the future hold more value when they are contextualized through stories.\n\nArjali\u00e8s recalled that the process took much longer than anyone initially expected, especially with the onset of COVID-19. The partners needed time to build trust and really listen to each other. And they are still not done.\n\nYet they have landed in a place of mutual understanding and respect, and there seems to be a pathway forward. In the end, the partners are optimistic they will develop a set of principles that can truly integrate Indigenous and non-Indigenous worldviews to conserve the Earth\u2019s resources for future generations.\n\nLearning from the Past to Guide the Future\n\nMuch has been written about the harsh truths of the way that colonialists treated Indigenous peoples. Too little has been written about how much can be learned from an Indigenous worldview\u2014a worldview that can change the way business sees itself and operates in the world.\n\nFor now, sustainable development seems elusive. Yet by educating themselves about an Indigenous worldview, business executives may be able to move meaningfully towards sustainable development.\n\nThe discovery of the 215 Indigenous children is tragic. It should be a catalytic moment to awaken our senses to a community of people who honor their past by making sure it shapes their present and future. Business leaders can learn from an Indigenous worldview\u2014most of all, to work toward a desirable future not just for business, but for all.\n\nA First Step toward Learning More\n\nTo learn more, I encourage you to read about the 94 calls to action from Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including six related to the residential school systems. You may also want to acknowledge the territory on which you reside or work. This is a way to not only show respect for ancestors, but also signal your appreciation of land and community.\n\nI live and work in London, Ontario, which is on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek (Ah-nish-in-a-bek), Haudenosaunee (Ho-den-no-show-nee), L\u016bnaap\u00e9ewak (Len-ahpay- wuk) and Attawandaron (Add-a-won-da-run) peoples, on lands connected with the London Township and Sombra Treaties of 1796 and the Dish with One Spoon Covenant Wampum. For generations, these peoples have cared for their community, the land, and waters, and they continue to do so. I wish to pay my respect to their Elders and acknowledge their status as the First Nations of Turtle Island.",

Many school districts have already made the switch away from Columbus Day, or in the case of Oklahoma, combined the two holidays.\n\nNew York City schools recently released the 2021-2022 school year calendar, which makes no mention of Columbus Day. The calendar also adds Juneteenth on June 20, 2022, as a holiday, when schools will be closed. That date is a Monday. Juneteenth is typically celebrated on June 19, which falls on a Sunday in 2022.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA push for federal recognition of Juneteenth gained steam last year after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. Last summer, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and James Lankford introduced an amendment proposing to replace Columbus Day with Juneteenth as a new federal holiday to avoid putting the U.S. \"further in debt.\"\n\n\"In response to a bipartisan effort to give federal workers another day of paid leave by designating Juneteenth a federal holiday, we have offered a counterproposal that does not put us further in debt,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"We support celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange. We chose Columbus Day as a holiday that is lightly celebrated, and least disruptive to Americans\u2019 schedules.\"",

            "content": "Mary Simon was named by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as Canada\u2019s next governor general. Her appointment came as Canada reckons with the discovery of hundreds of unmarked Indigenous graves, mostly children on the sites of former church-run schools.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we need more leaders like Ms. Simon in high office, people who understand what it means to take on real issues and create positive change. And that\u2019s exactly what brings us here today. This morning, I can announce that on my recommendation, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has approved the appointment of Ms. Mary Simon as the 30th governor general of Canada.\u201d \u201cLet me begin by conveying in the strongest possible terms that I am honored, humbled and ready to be Canada\u2019s first Indigenous governor general. I would also like to thank Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth for placing her trust and confidence in me to represent her in this wonderful country of ours. I can confidently say that my appointment is a historic and inspirational moment for Canada, and an important step forward on the long path towards reconciliation. This is a moment that I hope all Canadians feel part of because my appointment reflects our collective progress towards building a more inclusive, just and equitable society. The past is something that we have to come to terms with. But I am going to look forward to ensure that Canadians together will build a better Canada.\u201d\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe appointment of Mary Simon, a former ambassador, comes as Canada grapples with the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves, mainly of Indigenous children.\n\nMONTREAL \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Canada\u2019s first Indigenous governor general on Tuesday, a move with wide symbolic resonance as the country seeks to reconcile with its Indigenous population after decades of systemic mistreatment. The appointee, Mary Simon, a diplomat and leading Indigenous rights advocate, will represent Queen Elizabeth II as Canada\u2019s official head of state. While the role is largely ceremonial, it is high profile; the governor general is the crown\u2019s representative in Canada\u2019s system of constitutional monarchy. \u201cToday after 154 years, our country takes a historic step,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau while announcing the appointment at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. \u201cI cannot think of a better person to meet the moment.\u201d Ms. Simon, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, a village in northeastern Quebec, said on Tuesday that her appointment would help engender reconciliation.\n\n\u201cI can confidently say that my appointment is a historic and inspirational moment for Canada and an important step forward,\u201d she said, adding that it \u201ccomes at an especially reflective and dynamic time in our shared history.\u201d Ms. Simon, who was Canada\u2019s ambassador to Denmark, will take on her new role as Canada is having a national reckoning after the discovery of hundreds of unmarked Indigenous graves, many of them children, who attended church-run schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The finding of the graves has spurred national soul searching about the country\u2019s discrimination against Indigenous people, who for decades have been forced to grapple with racism, and inadequate access to health and economic opportunities. Ms. Simon\u2019s appointment reflects two critical policy priorities of Mr. Trudeau \u2014 reconciling with Indigenous people and promoting women\u2019s rights. But Indigenous groups have criticized him for failing to live up to his lofty promises. In February 2019, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada\u2019s first Indigenous justice minister, resigned from Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet in the midst of a controversy over how to handle a corruption case, after being moved from that post to minister of veteran\u2019s affairs, widely considered less influential. At the time, Indigenous groups said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s treatment of her raised questions about his commitment to righting past injustices.\n\nIndigenous leaders praised Ms. Simon as a skilled diplomat who was well placed to champion Indigenous concerns and mediate between the country\u2019s disparate groups. \u201cMary is a diplomat, an advocate and a strong Inuk Woman,\u201d Perry Bellegarde, the president of the Assembly of First Nations, a national organization representing Indigenous people, wrote on Twitter. The Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada said it was proud to have an Inuit in such a prominent representative role, but cautioned that Ms. Simon was \u201cbeing asked to serve the senior role in what is still a colonial system of governance.\u201d It called for the Canadian government to re-examine who was leading Canadian ministries dealing with Indigenous issues and services. While leaders across the political spectrum applauded her appointment as an important moment for Indigenous rights, Ms. Simon\u2019s lack of fluent French, one of Canada\u2019s official languages, was noted by some media in her native Quebec. She spoke on Tuesday in English and Inuktitut, reading a couple of sentences in French. In the speech, she herself acknowledged her lack of fluency in French, which she said was due to the lack of French education at her school. She said she would continue studying French and planned to conduct the business of the governor general in both English and French, as well as Inuktitut, one of many Indigenous languages spoken across the country. Ms. Simon said she had been deeply formed by her Indigenous upbringing. \u201cI spent my adolescence in Nunavik, living a very traditional lifestyle,\u201d she said, referring to an area in northern Quebec. \u201cMany months out of the year, we camped and lived on the land,\u201d she said, adding that she maintained \u201can active connection with our Inuit heritage and language.\u201d\n\nShe credited her grandmother and mother for being role models, instilling in her an abiding desire to learn and a commitment to give back to the community. \u201cThey also taught me to always be proud of who I am, and to keep my mind open to other points of view,\u201d she said. Ms. Simon began her career in the 1970s as a broadcaster for the CBC, Canada\u2019s national broadcaster, before attaining several leadership positions in Indigenous organizations. She helped broker a landmark land claim settlement in 1975 between the Cree and Inuit community in Quebec\u2019s north and the Quebec government. She has also been president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, an organization championing Inuit rights. In 1994, she was Ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs, defending Canadian interests in its sprawling Arctic territory, home to more than 200,000 inhabitants, more than half of whom are Indigenous. She became the first Inuk to hold an ambassadorial position. Her appointment as governor general comes after the resignation of Julie Payette, who stepped down in January after months of media reports that she and a top adviser had belittled and publicly humiliated employees, often reducing them to tears. In response, the government commissioned an independent review that several Canadian news outlets said had blamed her for fomenting a toxic work environment.",

Ms. Simon\u2019s appointment reflects two critical policy priorities of Mr. Trudeau \u2014 reconciling with Indigenous people and promoting women\u2019s rights. While leaders across the political spectrum applauded her appointment as an important moment for Indigenous rights, Ms. Simon\u2019s lack of fluent French, one of Canada\u2019s official languages, was noted by some media in her native Quebec. Ms. Simon began her career in the 1970s as a broadcaster for the CBC, Canada\u2019s national broadcaster, before attaining several leadership positions in Indigenous organizations.",

They were created to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children by taking them from their homes and forbidding them from speaking their native languages or engaging in cultural practices, the outlet reported.\n\nThe schools were hotbeds for forced labor and physical, emotional and sexual abuse and at least 150,000 kids attended them throughout their existence, the outlet reported.\n\nIn 2015, a historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission probing the residential school\u2019s history described them as a \u201cculture of genocide\u201d targeting Indigenous people in Canada.\n\nFormer attendees of the school told the commission the conditions were brutal \u2014 living spaces were unsanitary, insufficiently heated and \u201cEvery Indian student smelled of hunger,\u201d one former pupil who attended in the 1920s said.\n\nOutbreaks of measles, tuberculosis, influenza and other contagious diseases were rampant at the facility and many kids died as a result.\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told CBC the discovery confirms what the community has known for years \u2014 many kids were sent to the school and never returned.\n\n\u201cThere may be reasons why they wouldn\u2019t record the deaths properly and that they weren\u2019t treated with dignity and respect because that was the whole purpose of the residential school \u2026 to take total control of Indian children, to remove their culture, identity and connection to their family,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nCasimir told CBC that a report will be provided on the discovery next month and the findings are \u201cpreliminary.\u201d",

            "content": "New York City public schools have ditched Columbus Day, its Department of Education announced this week in a controversial decision criticized afterward by local Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nCity schools will still be closed on the second Monday in October, but not in the name of honoring Christopher Columbus, the Italian explorer who made several voyages to the Americas centuries ago.\n\nInstead, the Department of Education said that students will have off from school that date for Indigenous People\u2019s Day in recognition of the Native Americans who first called the future U.S. home.\n\nThe switch was rebuked soon after the city released its calendar for the 2021-2022 school year Tuesday, however, and within hours the date appeared differently on the Department of Education website.\n\nSometime later Tuesday, the New York City Department of Education website was updated to say that public schools will be closed in recognition of \u201cItalian Heritage/Indigenous People\u2019s Day\u201d on Oct. 15.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, told reporters early Wednesday that neither he nor the head of the city\u2019s school system had been notified before Columbus Day was dropped for Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t hear about the change, nor did the chancellor, so we spoke about it and we both agreed this was not the right way to handle things,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during a press conference.\n\n\u201cI think saying it\u2019s a day to celebrate Italian-American heritage is absolutely right and appropriate, and that\u2019s the way to talk about it and to think about it,\u201d said Mr. de Blasio, an Italian-American. \u201cI think also saying, as has been done in many parts of the country, it\u2019s a day to think about history and honor indigenous people as well. I agree with that, too. So the process wasn\u2019t right, but the end result is going to be a day to honor Italian-American heritage, a day to honor indigenous people, I think that\u2019s a good way forward.\u201d\n\nPrior to rebranding the date to recognize both indigenous people and Italian-Americans, the New York City Department of Education drew rebuke from local Republicans for having ditched Columbus Day.\n\n\u201cColumbus Day has long been a celebration of Italian-American history & culture,\u201d New York City Councilman Steven Matteo, a Republican whose constituents include residents of the Mid Island neighborhood in Staten Island, said in a statement on social media. \u201cIt is, frankly, insulting that the DOE has unilaterally decided that Italian-Americans are no longer worthy of recognition.\u201d\n\nNew York City Councilman Joe Borelli, another Staten Island Republican, initially slammed the swapping of Columbus Day for Indigenous People\u2019s Day as \u201cinsulting woke nonsense\u201d from the school system.\n\nLater, after it became apparent the school holiday would recognize Italian-Americans as well, Mr. Borelli criticized that decision, too.\n\n\u201cThey tried, they got caught, they changed it, they covered the mistake. Cowards. Just have the gumption to cancel the day,\u201d Mr. Borelli said on the social media service Twitter.\n\nColumbus Day has been considered a federal holiday in the U.S. since 1971, although multiple states and cities have decided in recent years to recognize the date as Indigenous People\u2019s Day instead.\n\nStarting in 1492, the voyages made by Columbus led to the colonization of the Americas and, in turn, the violent removal of indigenous people from their homeland through forced displacement.",

            "content": "A New Jersey school board has voted to overturn a decision that took all holiday names off the district calendar, following conflict over an earlier decision to refer to Columbus Day as \"Indigenous Peoples' Day.\"\n\nThe Randolph Board of Education had voted on June 10 to eliminate all the names of holidays from the school calendar, instead opting to simply label them as a \"day off.\" The vote was a reaction to backlash over the renaming of Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day on the school calendar. However, with Monday's 8-1 vote, all the holiday names were reinstated, with Indigenous Peoples' Day once again referred to as Columbus Day.\n\nDuring two-and-a-half hours of public comment ahead of the vote, some claimed that redoing the calendar was a harbinger of \" Critical Race Theory ,\" while others said that it was the first step in the \"systematic destruction of our culture.\"\n\nSome also said Columbus Day was an important part of their Italian-American heritage, with a few arguing that erasing the name of holidays from the calendar would stifle diversity rather than encourage it.\n\nMany cities and states have ditched Columbus Day, choosing to observe Indigenous Peoples' Day in its place. Columbus Day is still a federal holiday recognized by the US government, but more than 130 cities have chosen to recognize Indigenous Peoples' Day instead.\n\nThe argument against naming the day after Christopher Columbus is largely tied to his role in the mass slaughter and violent colonization of indigenous groups across the Americas. When New Mexico replaced the holiday with Indigenous Peoples' Day in 2019, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez praised the move. \"For many years, Indigenous people have protested Columbus Day because it celebrates colonialism, oppression, and injustice inflicted on Indigenous peoples,\" Nez said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"Observing Indigenous Peoples' Day allows citizens to recognize our rich heritage and represents a step toward healing and growth.\"",

            "content": "Leaders of an Indigenous group said on Thursday that they had discovered the remains of as many as 751 people, mainly Indigenous children, at the site of a former school in Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1898, the Marieval Residential School opened its doors and it closed its doors, in 1996. The Roman Catholic Church overseeing the gravesite, the Catholics and the prayer and religion overseeing the grave site, we started our radar-penetrating research on June the 2nd of 2021. As of yesterday, we have hit 751 unmarked graves. Of the 751 hits the machine has a 10 to 15 percent error percentage. So we will only go by the hits that we have of 751. But we do know there\u2019s at least 600. We cannot affirm that they are all children. But there are oral stories that there are adults in this grave site as well. An assault on a First Nation people \u2014 we are proud people. The only crime we ever committed as children was being born Indigenous. A lot of work, a lot of healing will take place. There are many sites that we\u2019re going to be doing this similar work. And we will find more.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn Indigenous group said the remains of as many as 751 people, mainly children, had been found in unmarked graves on the site of a former boarding school in Saskatchewan.\n\nCALGARY, Alberta \u2014 For decades, the Indigenous children were taken from their families, sometimes by force, and housed in crowded, church-run boarding schools, where they were abused and prohibited from speaking their languages. Thousands vanished altogether. Now, a new discovery offers chilling evidence that many of the missing children may have died at these schools: The remains of as many as 751 people, mainly Indigenous children, were found at the site of a former school in the province of Saskatchewan, an Indigenous group said on Thursday. The burial site, the largest one to date, was uncovered only weeks after the remains of 215 children were found in unmarked graves on the grounds of another former church-run school for Indigenous students in British Columbia. The discoveries have jolted a nation grappling with generations of widespread and systematic abuse of Indigenous people, many of whom are survivors of the boarding schools. For decades, they suggested through their oral histories that thousands of children disappeared from the schools, but they were often met with skepticism. The revelations of two unmarked grave sites are another searing reminder of this traumatic period in history.\n\n\u201cThis was a crime against humanity, an assault on a First Nation people,\u201d said Chief Bobby Cameron, of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, the provincial federation of Indigenous groups. \u201cThe only crime we ever committed as children was being born Indigenous,\u201d he said. The burial site also puts new pressure on the current government of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, which even today relies on a set of laws that govern the lives of Indigenous people that date back to the 19th century. Indigenous leaders say they hope the latest revelations will be a catalyst for their long sought-after self-governance. \u201cWe are tired of being told what to do and how to do it,\u201d said Chief Cadmus Delorme, of the Cowessess First Nation. The recent unearthing of remains in Canada has reverberated globally, including in the United States, where this week the interior secretary said the country would search federal boarding schools for possible burial sites of Native American children. Hundreds of thousands of them were forcibly taken from their communities to be culturally assimilated in the schools for more than a century.\n\nBoth schools were part of a system started in the 19th century that took Indigenous children from their families. A National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 2008 to investigate the residential schools, called the practice \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d Many children never returned home, and their families were given only vague explanations of their fates, or none at all. Canada had about 150 residential schools and an estimated 150,000 Indigenous children passed through the schools between their opening, around 1883, and their closing in 1996. The commission estimated that about 4,100 children went missing nationwide from the schools. But an Indigenous former judge who led the commission, Murray Sinclair, said in an email this month that he now believed the number was \u201cwell beyond 10,000.\u201d\n\nChief Delorme also called for Pope Francis to apologize, saying that the Roman Catholic Church needed to address its actions. \u201cThe incredible burden of the past is still with us, and the truth of that past needs to come out, however painful,\u201d Don Bolen, the Archbishop of Regina, wrote in a letter Thursday addressed to the Cowessess group. He apologized and pledged to \u201cdo what we can to turn that apology into meaningful concrete acts.\u201d The discovery in Saskatchewan was made by the Cowessess First Nation at the Marieval Indian Residential School, about 87 miles from the provincial capital, Regina.\n\nChief Delorme said that his Indigenous community, spurred by the discovery at Kamloops and in conjunction with technical teams from Saskatchewan Polytechnic, began combing the area using ground penetrating radar on June 2, hitting as many as 751 unmarked graves. He said he expected more bodies would be found. While it is not clear how the discovery of the remains will be investigated, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Saskatchewan said that next steps, including the potential involvement of the force, would depend on the wishes of the Indigenous group\u2019s leaders. \u201cOur actions must be respectful of the immense grief the people of Cowessess First Nation continue to suffer. We know we have enforced racist and discriminatory legislation and policies,\u201d a police spokesman said in an email.\n\nFor Canada\u2019s 1.7 million Indigenous citizens, who make up about 4.9 percent of the population, the finding of yet another mass burial site is a visceral reminder of centuries of discrimination and abuse, which has led to intergenerational trauma among survivors of residential schools and their families. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying this: All of the stories told by our survivors are true,\u201d Chief Cameron said. Florence Sparvier, 80, an elder of the Cowessess First Nation, said she attended two residential schools, including Marieval, the school where the unmarked remains were found. \u201cThey were very condemning about our people,\u201d she said of the nuns at the schools. \u201cThey told us our people, our parents, our grandparents didn\u2019t have a way to be spiritual because we were all heathens.\u201d Mr. Trudeau on Thursday called the discoveries in Saskatchewan and British Columbia \u201cpart of a larger tragedy,\u201d citing the legacies of \u201csystemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced.\u201d In September 2017, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged the nation\u2019s past \u201chumiliation, neglect and abuse\u201d of Indigenous people, and vowed in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly to improve their lives.\n\nSince the Kamloops announcement, Chief Cameron said, he has been traveling around the province, where farming and mining are major industries, looking at former school sites. \u201cYou can see with your plain eye the indent of the ground where these bodies are to be found,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday night. \u201cThese children are sitting there, waiting to be found.\u201d",

The burial site also puts new pressure on the current government of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, which even today relies on a set of laws that govern the lives of Indigenous people that date back to the 19th century. \n\nBoth schools were part of a system started in the 19th century that took Indigenous children from their families. In September 2017, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged the nation\u2019s past \u201chumiliation, neglect and abuse\u201d of Indigenous people, and vowed in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly to improve their lives.\n\nSince the Kamloops announcement, Chief Cameron said, he has been traveling around the province, where farming and mining are major industries, looking at former school sites. \u201cYou can see with your plain eye the indent of the ground where these bodies are to be found,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday night. \u201cThese children are sitting there, waiting to be found.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA Times Canada correspondent recalls how meeting an Indigenous chef gave him a powerful and belated history lesson about Canada\u2019s mistreatment of Indigenous people.\n\nAn Indigenous boy raped by a priest and forced by another to scrub away the brown from his knuckles until they bled. These images haunted me this week as I reported on the discovery in Saskatchewan of the remains of as many as 751 people, many of them children, on the verdant lands of an Indigenous group. [Read: Hundreds More Unmarked Graves Found at Former Residential School in Canada] The boy was Solomon Wawatay, now 63, a survivor of a residential school in Quebec and the father of Cezin Nottaway, a charismatic chef who gave me my long overdue Indigenous education. Like the children whose remains were discovered this week, Mr. Wawatay was among the 150,000 Indigenous children who passed through one of the church-run schools between 1883 and 1996. Many later said they were sexually, emotionally and physically abused, and barred from speaking their languages. Others vanished, their parents left to ponder their fates.\n\n[Read: How Thousands of Indigenous Children Vanished in Canada] The Saskatchewan discovery \u2014 just weeks after a similar finding of unmarked graves in British Columbia \u2014 was a chilling reminder of Canada\u2019s longstanding mistreatment of Indigenous people. It also recalled our country\u2019s historical amnesia when it comes to taking responsibility for Indigenous suffering. When I was growing up in Montreal in the 1980s, my first encounter with Indigenous people came in my high school history text book where we learned how 17th-century French settlers in what is now Quebec encountered fierce resistance from the Iroquois nation, who were portrayed as barbaric warriors. While I went on to study history at university and learned about the perils of minority voices being silenced, it was only after I returned to Canada about four years ago that I had a vital, belated history lesson when reporting a profile of Ms. Nottaway, an Indigenous chef. She told me about how she had turned to her grandmothers\u2019 moose meat and rabbit recipes for healing and cultural affirmation.\n\nOn Friday, still shaken by the Saskatchewan story, I called her and her father, Solomon Wawatay, and asked them how the week\u2019s events had affected them. Mr. Wawatay told me that the discovery had stirred difficult memories. In the 1960s, he had been removed from his parents at the age of 6 and sent to a residential school in Amos, in northwestern Quebec. There, at the age of 8, he said, he was raped by a priest in his 30s. \u201cI was only a child. I kept it hidden because I didn\u2019t want to be made fun of,\u201d he told me, sobbing. \u201cHe was never prosecuted or faced punishment.\u201d He also recalled an incident when another priest had forced him to scrub his knuckles until they bled, recalling that he had said, \u201cGet that dirty color off your hand, you dirty Indian!\u201d Mr. Wawatay said he was also beaten. At the school, Mr. Wawatay said he and other Indigenous children weren\u2019t allowed to speak their native Algonquin language. So they would sneak away to the forest to snare rabbits and speak Algonquin among themselves, away from the prying eyes of the priests. He finally left the school at 13, but Mr. Wawatay said his experiences there remained with him and other survivors, some of whom used alcohol to try to numb the pain. He said the parents of children who had been taken away were also deeply traumatized.\n\nMr. Wawatay said: \u201cSome parents drank because their kids were gone. Many had feared that if they didn\u2019t send their kids to the schools, they would be arrested. As a result of the residential schools, we had social problems like malnutrition, dirty diapers, alcoholism.\u201d Ms. Nottaway recalled that her mother, Suzanne Nottaway, had scars on her body from repeated whippings at a residential school. She was so emotionally shaken when the younger Ms. Nottaway was growing up that she struggled to say, \u201cI love you.\u201d Her father, she added, had turned to alcohol and became indescribably sad. \u201cWe are responsible to help our parents by carrying the pain that they endured,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is not the past. As this week reminded us, the repercussions are still happening.\u201d Today Suzanne Nottaway works in a prison where she teaches inmates about Indigenous culture, while Mr. Wawatay is a leader of his community. Suzanne Nottaway with her grandchildren (from left): Quill, Willow and Ryder in Kitigan Zibi, Quebec, in 2019. For Mr. Wawatay, healing gradually began in his 40s, he told me, after an elder told him to let go of the pain and draw strength from the traditions of his ancestors. It is a lesson he has passed on to his children and grandchildren. \u201cAll my high school years, I walked on eggs until my elders taught me that this is my land, this is our way of life, and I began to defend myself that way,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt takes strength to forgive and I did it before, but this week brought back a lot of anger,\u201d he added.\n\nHe told me he hoped the latest revelations would be a catalyst for expanding Indigenous rights, including gaining autonomy over their lands. On his people\u2019s land, he said, white hunters routinely trespassed during moose-hunting season, forcing the community to set up road blocks. Ms. Nottaway added her hope that news of the graves would shake Canada out of its historical complacency, and prod a new national reckoning about the past. \u201cIn the past they took our voices away,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut now Canada can no longer hide from it. Are you going to deny the bones of children?\u201d",

It also recalled our country\u2019s historical amnesia when it comes to taking responsibility for Indigenous suffering. When I was growing up in Montreal in the 1980s, my first encounter with Indigenous people came in my high school history text book where we learned how 17th-century French settlers in what is now Quebec encountered fierce resistance from the Iroquois nation, who were portrayed as barbaric warriors. At the school, Mr. Wawatay said he and other Indigenous children weren\u2019t allowed to speak their native Algonquin language.",

            "content": "Maybe they should have explored this idea \u2014 or even checked with City Hall \u2014 before moving ahead full sail.\n\nAs backlash over its previously unannounced decision to scrap Columbus Day snowballed Tuesday, the New York City Department of Education later said it would now close schools on Oct. 11 for \u201cItalian Heritage Day/Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cCity Hall wants Italian Heritage Day and Indigenous People\u2019s Day so no one is left out,\u201d said Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s spokesman Bill Neidhardt as confusion reigned over the woke imbroglio.\n\nAsked whether City Hall had been aware of the decision to wipe Columbus Day from the school calendar, Neidhardt only said, \u201cWe do not agree with not including Italian Heritage Day.\u201d\n\nEducation Department spokeswoman Danielle Filson told The Post the calendar posted online Tuesday morning had been \u201cupdated\u201d after initially referring to the holiday that once honored the Italian explorer only as \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cItalian Heritage Day/Indigenous People\u2019s Day will celebrate the contributions and legacies of Italian Americans and recognize that Native people are the first inhabitants of the land that became our country,\u201d Filson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy including these holidays on our calendar we are honoring the past, present, and future contributions of Indigenous communities and Italian Americans.\u201d\n\nSchools Chancellor Meisha Ross also seemed to try and play cleanup, writing on Twitter that discussions about renaming the Columbus holiday began last year, in an effort \u201cto better reflect and honor more than just one person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now Italian Heritage/Indigenous People\u2019s Day, honoring the contributions of Italian-Americans as well as our indigenous communities,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBrooklyn Councilman Mark Treyger, chair of the Education Committee, said he was blindsided by the change.\n\n\u201cThere was no consultation with the Council or my committee on this,\u201d Treyger fumed. \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m hearing a lot of anger.\u201d\n\nThe retroactive nod to Italian heritage comes after politicians of Italian descent and advocates trashed the \u201cwoke\u201d move to cancel Columbus, which they said was an insult to their culture and possible violation of their civil rights.\n\nThe DOE backtrack to include Italian Heritage did not seem to quell their concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely outrageous that the Department of Education did this, and I\u2019m going to try to build a coalition to fight this,\u201d said US Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Nassau), adding that tacking on Italian Heritage Day just \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cColumbus Day has been in place for a long, long period of time, and it\u2019s important to Italian Americans who faced tremendous discrimination in this country,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nAssembly Education Committee Chairman Michael Benedetto (D-Bronx), said the move was \u201coffensive to me and all Italian-Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they would so something like that. You\u2019re diluting the meaning of the holiday,\u201d Benedetto said, adding that \u201cIt\u2019s equally offensive to indigenous people, who should also have a separate day of recognition.\u201d\n\nCouncilman Bob Holden, a Queens Democrat, agreed that removing Columbus from the school calendar was \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to Italian-American New Yorkers, saying that the explorer \u201cis a symbol of Italian heritage here in New York and around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cItalian American students are entitled to the same rights as other groups. These include the federally guaranteed right of equal protection,\u201d Angelo Vivolo of the Columbus Heritage Coalition said following the initial news of Columbus Day\u2019s cancelation.\n\n\u201cWe reserve the right to defend our students and our culture in the courts and the ballot box in New York, where nearly 20 percent identify as having Italian racial heritage,\u201d Vivolo said.\n\nBronx-born actor Chazz Palminteri told The Post that the DOE\u2019s decision \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor millions of Italians across the country and world, it will always be Columbus Day. To us, it\u2019s our day. It\u2019s in our minds and in our hearts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Italian explorer\u2019s legacy has been hotly-contested in the Big Apple since Mayor Bill de Blasio launched a \u201cMonuments Commission\u201d in 2018 to reconsider statues of historical figures who\u2019s past included connections to slavery or oppression.\n\nDozens of cities and jurisdictions across the US have ditched Columbus Day to honor Native Americans instead \u2014 following the lead of ultra-liberal Berkeley, Calif., which began observing the latter holiday in 1992.\n\nThe state legislature or City Council could pass a bill in order to formally change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, though it doesn\u2019t appear that either body has made moves to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if any \u2014 power the mayor would have to swap the holiday\u2019s name beyond the school calendar, or possibly, the city calendar.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo in October signed legislation making Juneteenth a recognized holiday in New York State, and de Blasio also marked it as an official holiday in New York City.",

            "content": "Great Britain and Chile teams took a knee on the pitch before their match, and the United States and Sweden teams knelt ahead of their clash on Wednesday.\n\nIt's been almost five years since former NFL player Colin Kaepernick knelt during a pre-game National Anthem to protest racial inequality. Since then, and especially since George Floyd's death in police custody in May 2020, players of other sports and around the world have made the gesture in solidarity with the equality movement and against the oppression of people of color.\n\n\"For us, it feels right to stand up for human rights. There was communication with the US team,\" Swedish defender Amanda Ilestedt said after the match. \"It feels good to do that. It is something we stand for as a team.\"\n\nThe women's soccer team from New Zealand took a knee before their opening match against Australia. The Aussies remained standing with their arms locked together.\n\nThe Australian team posed for a pregame picture with the country's indigenous flag. Midfielder Tameka Yallop said after the match that the team is against racism but wanted to show support to the \"broader Indigenous Australians.\" \"We are obviously in support of no racism, we definitely wanted to take a stand and show our support of that, and we also wanted to represent not just Kyah Simon and Lydia Williams within our team, but the broader Indigenous Australians, and give our own Australian flare to shed light on that aspect of it as well. We just wanted to stand together for the Australian culture and the Indigenous side of us,\" Yallop said. Kyah Simon and Lydia Williams are Aboriginal members of the team. On Wednesday, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach confirmed that kneeling did not violate the organization's rules against protesting. \"It is allowed, it is not a violation of the rules,\" Bach said. In April, the ban preventing athletes from protesting or demonstrating at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was upheld by the IOC, but the committee later announced it was amending that. Under the new guidelines, athletes can protest on the field before a competition or while they are being introduced, as long as the expression is not targeted \"directly or indirectly, against people, countries and/or their dignity.\"",

            "content": "California has more types of native plants than any other state in the U.S., a third of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Why should we care about native plants? They are the foundation of our ecosystem, they support our native animal species like the monarch butterfly, and they are part of California\u2019s rich Indigenous peoples history.\n\nIndigenous cultural and plant educator Nicholas Hummingbird is on a mission to spread his knowledge of native plants through the traditional and ongoing knowledge of Indigenous peoples. Hummingbird descends from Cahuilla and Apache nations and was the founder and previous manager of Hahamongna Nursery, a native plant nursery in Pasadena. He has worked on the Channel Islands doing large-scale habitat restoration with the National Park Service. Hummingbird shares his knowledge of native plants through speaking engagements with high schools, universities and Zoom webinars that he announces through his Instagram.\n\nHere, Hummingbird shares what he believes to be the seven most important native plants. Learn more about California native plants through our @latimesplants Instagram Live session with Hummingbird.\n\nLet me share with you just one part of an ongoing story, a story that is thousands of years old, and it centers around what is the human translation of our natural environment here in Southern California. This place has recently become home for millions of people from around the world and a focal point of environmental loss and devastation; tied to that very plight is the story of Indigenous peoples. I cannot separate the plight of our ecosystems full of life given by plants, stewarded by animals and contextualized by Indigenous peoples out of the scope of where we find ourselves today.\n\nSee the images of the beauty that we still have here in Southern California, the languages that speak to them and a people who continue to be the caretakers, activists and stewards of them. Acknowledging native plant presence hasn\u2019t always been on most gardeners\u2019 minds or a part of their awareness. Hopefully that can change. It\u2019s also how I can relate as a native person, that I feel that there is little acknowledgment when it comes to the natural environment, including native plants, native animals and native peoples.\n\nIf there was a specific native plant I was to begin with, it would be with our native oak trees. Once abundant and plentiful all over California, too few remain of these long-lived and giving ancestors. To consider a plant medicinal, most people think of pain or comfort management, but that\u2019s too simple; medicine is a healthy land, healthy water and healthy air, all of which the oak trees constantly give us. As a keystone species, their existence provides habitat for thousands of beings while sequestering large amounts of carbon at net zero supplemental water. The same cannot be said for every non-native tree in our landscapes today. Oak trees have incredible power. The acorns they produce nourish all beings, from birds to deer and even bears, but most important, Indigenous peoples. I pray we can allow oak trees to flourish once more in our urban space as they have for thousands of years. That\u2019s the first step in helping to heal this place and create an equitable environment for the future as it has always been in the past.\n\nThis plant is fire-resistant and iconic of the rarest ecosystems we have left, the coastal sage scrub plant community. Lemonade berries curb erosion and adapt to a variety of soil types; they are an effective fire barrier and great for pruning into hedges. The lemonade berry is a direct replacement for most non-native shrubs in our urban landscapes. Their berries, once boiled and steeped for a couple of days, will make a drink that tastes just like lemonade and is full of antioxidants and antivirals.\n\nThe chaparral yucca is a plant someone can easily ignore and overlook but it\u2019s truly undeniable when it flowers. Unfortunately, this is the last stage of the yucca\u2019s life cycle, when it blooms after an average 10-year period. But the plant\u2019s afterlife is just as crucial in providing millions of seeds that nourish dozens of species and, one day, sprout new plants. One important indicator of yucca going to flower is that much of our major rainstorms are behind us as we head into summer. Chaparral yucca are crucial in that they provide so much culture to Indigenous peoples, but one culture cannot be ignored, and that is the symbiotic relationship with the yucca moth, the only pollinator that can give this plant its afterlife of seed and continuance.\n\nIt can be hard to believe of the 6,000-plus native plants in California, very few still are referred to by their Indigenous names. Toyon comes from the Ohlone language and is just one of many names Indigenous peoples have for this plant. In fact, hundreds of names exist for toyon and most California native plants. The toyon once abundant in many spaces can be once again; it is a true lifeline for local and migratory species of birds, insects, mammals and humans. The plant is related to something most of us consume today: apples. These berries need processing to be edible, but it is another plant that has incredible benefits to our urban and natural areas. Consider planting a toyon or replacing a non-native shrub with one. It\u2019s an evergreen that flowers in the summer and gives berries throughout the fall and winter.\n\nAdjacent to many spaces like freeways and developments is the unappreciated cornerstone of life in Southern California, the common buckwheat. Flowering throughout the summer months, this plant is a lifeline for pollinators like butterflies. In fact, some of the rarest butterfly species are found in SoCal and many need particular buckwheat plants to survive. The common buckwheat turns a beautiful rust red color toward the end of summer and into fall, signaling the seasonal change. The plentiful seeds can sustain local and migratory bird species and hopefully result in many more plants in spaces that continue to be disturbed or altered, as buckwheat is able to adapt to a changing environment. Like all native plants, common buckwheat show and teaches us resilience.\n\nWith elderberry gaining attention and popularity, it\u2019s important to point out most elderberry products in stores today come from a species of elderberry that originated a world away, in Europe. Much the same variety or close to it grows locally in California. The California blue elderberry is a tree of life and possibility, flowering and providing fruit. By far one of the easiest native plants to grow, it thrives if given the opportunity to do so. Sustainability is having a plant that benefits the environment as a whole, and that\u2019s exactly what the California blue elderberry does.\n\nIn the world of plants everyone appreciates flowers, trees, fruits and vegetables. Not many will say grasses, let alone our native bunchgrass species. They are so valuable and crucial to our future. They live to be hundreds of years old, sequester huge amounts of carbon and have transitioned to be more effective than many trees in our landscape as they are less impacted by drought and wildfire. In fact, they thrive with both, because their massive root systems hold together earth, restore water and sequester huge amounts of carbon underground. Under the conditions that most trees release carbon, they keep it stored. They are a true foundation for our ecosystem and are a quick way to restore California\u2019s environmental integrity.",

            "content": "A new petition is calling on New Jersey school board members to resign after they voted to remove holiday names from the official school calendar Thursday.\n\nThe petition was created by a user with the name Thomas Tatem on Friday and demands Randolph Township school board members and Superintendent Jen Fano to \"resign immediately,\" saying they \"clearly do not have the best interests of our children in anything they do.\"\n\nNYC DAD WHO PULLED DAUGHTER FROM PRIVATE SCHOOL OVER \u2018ANTIRACIST\u2019 TEACHINGS LAUNCHES PARENT SUPPORT SITE\n\nThe board voted to start listing holidays, including religious and national holidays such as Thanksgiving and Memorial Day as \"day off\" on the school calendar after receiving backlash for renaming Columbus Day as Indigenous People's Day.\n\n\"If we don\u2019t have anything on the calendar, we don\u2019t have to have anyone [with] hurt feelings or anything like that,\" Dorene Roche, one of the board members, told Fox 5.\n\nBoard members did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News.\n\nRandolph Township Schools Director of Communications and Digital Media, Matthew Pfouts, told Fox News that Superintendent Fano was not involved in the board's vote.\n\n\"In partnership with the Randolph Township School district, the Board of Education has always been committed to supporting diversity and inclusion amongst our students, staff, and community,\" Pfouts said in a statement. \"We believe an effective partnership can only be accomplished between the schools and the community through collective input from all stakeholders. Involvement and communication with our constituents help us guide policy decisions/changes and improve district protocols.\"\n\nDESANTIS CONDEMNS CRITICAL RACE THEORY, SAYS IT WON'T BE TAUGHT IN FLORIDA CLASSROOMS\n\nHe added that the vote to rename Columbus Day was made \"after careful consideration of concerns introduced by both proponents of the change as well as those in opposition to the change.\"\n\n\"We agreed unanimously that the change would be both inclusive and equitable,\" he said. \"Although we have made these changes to the school district\u2019s calendar, our decision to change the calendar titles will not impact the education of holidays as guided by the district\u2019s curriculum.\"\n\nThe petition has garnered more than 200 signatures, though it is unclear whether signatories are residents of Randolph Township.\n\nCRITICAL RACE THEORY: DIVERSE GROUP OF MOTHERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY SPEAK OUT\n\n\"We will not allow our beautiful town to be taken over by woke cancel culture,\" one signatory, named Frank Tomasiello, commented on the petition posted to Change.org. \"History exist[s] so we can learn from it\u2026 The good, the bad, and the ugly. And you have now become part of the ugly.\"\n\nAnother signatory named Michael Guarnieri wrote that \"as an Italian American losing Columbus Day was bad enough but as a Christian losing Easter [and] Christmas is even worse.\"\n\n\"Also I\u2019m [sic] a community with so many Jewish brothers and sisters losing their high holidays is a disgrace,\" Guarnieri wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA similar Change.org petition, created by a user named Franco Piarulli three weeks ago that has garnered more than 1,000 signatures, calls on the school board to celebrate both Colombus Day and Indigenous People's Day on different dates.\n\n\"I am signing because the Board voted without allowing public comment,\" signatory Robert Tarte commented. \"Indigenous people[s] day is already recognized on August 9. I have no objection to celebrating Indigenous property day, but why take our holiday which has great meaning for Italian Americans.\"\n\nA number of school boards and locales across the United States have changed the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day in an effort to commemorate Native Americans who lost their lives or livelihoods when the U.S. was colonized.",

            "description": "This School Board Got Rid of Columbus Day. Then Thanksgiving Went, Too.  The New York Times",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA New Jersey school district, criticized for renaming the day for Indigenous people, eliminated the names of all holidays. It might undo that, too.\n\nThis School Board Got Rid of Columbus Day. Then Thanksgiving Went, Too.\n\nA month ago, the school board in a northern New Jersey suburb followed the lead of at least six other states and scores of municipalities when it voted unanimously to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Outrage followed, prompting the district to approve an extreme workaround intended to sidestep the complicated terrain of identity politics in an increasingly polarized nation: Holidays from school would no longer be labeled on the district calendar at all. Rosh Hashana, Thanksgiving, Veterans Day and the second Monday in October \u2014 whatever it might be called \u2014 would instead be marked only as \u201cday off\u201d from school in Randolph, a township about 40 miles west of New York City. Then, on Wednesday, the school board said it was considering a complete about-face, scheduling a meeting for next week to vote on a resolution to restore all holiday names, including Columbus Day, to the district\u2019s calendar.\n\n\u201cTheir attempt to address diversity essentially has caused division,\u201d said State Senator Anthony M. Bucco, a Republican who represents the township. \u201cBy trying to make everything vanilla, you lose that sense of diversity.\u201d The controversy comes as the country grapples with how to recognize historical figures that are seen as symbols of white supremacy. In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer in Minneapolis, statues of Columbus and Civil War leaders have been defaced, toppled or removed in cities across the country. Last month, New York City, which operates the country\u2019s largest school system, faced criticism after initially trying to rename Columbus Day for Indigenous people. In response, the city similarly attempted to split the difference: The second Monday in October is now labeled Italian Heritage Day/Indigenous People\u2019s Day on school calendars. The convoluted back-and-forth in Randolph may itself be harmful to students\u2019 understanding of Columbus\u2019s role in history, the treatment of Native Americans and the origins of the holiday, said Leslie Wilson, a professor of history at Montclair State University in New Jersey who has spoken on panels about renaming Columbus Day. \u201cNow kids don\u2019t know what to believe anymore,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. \u201cEveryone is confused.\u201d A spokesman for Randolph Township Schools said board members would have no comment before Monday\u2019s meeting. The superintendent, he said, had no involvement in the holiday-naming decisions and also would have no comment.\n\nThe resolution \u2014 the only item of new business on the agenda for next week\u2019s meeting \u2014 states that \u201cthe Board of Education hereby rescinds the action taken at the June 10, 2021, meeting removing the names of all holidays from the school district calendar.\u201d Randolph, an affluent Morris County township of about 25,000 people, is 80 percent white; no residents identify as Native American, according to the most recent census data available. There are four recognized Native American tribes in New Jersey, including the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation, which is based in the northern section of the state. The initiative to rename Columbus Day reportedly stemmed from a recommendation by a local diversity and inclusion committee. The board approved the name change on May 13, after minimal discussion, and then backtracked earlier this month. One online petition last month drew more than 1,100 signatures and comments criticizing \u201cwoke\u201d cancel culture. A second petition calling for the immediate resignation of the superintendent and board members generated more than 4,000 signatures and a flurry of media attention. The board said its decision had been \u201cmisconstrued\u201d and that the meaning behind the unnamed holidays would still be taught. \u201cSchools will still be closed on the days that we originally approved and our children will know why,\u201d the board explained on Sunday in a statement.\n\nSenator Bucco was among those who spoke out against renaming Columbus Day at last Thursday\u2019s raucous board meeting. He said he was heartened that the school calendar may restore the names of all state and federal holidays. \u201cIf they want to add Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day to the calendar, then by all means do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t violate Italian Americans\u2019 civil rights by removing only them.\u201d Columbus Day has been celebrated as a federal holiday on the second Monday of October since 1971, according to the Library of Congress, but has been observed for centuries. The first recorded celebration was in New York City in 1792. In 1892, then-President Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation that recommended local celebrations, in part in response to anti-Catholic and anti-Italian sentiments and the murder of 11 Sicilian men in New Orleans. New York and New Jersey are home to the country\u2019s largest populations of residents who identify as Italian American. Ten miles north of Randolph, a section of Interstate Route 80 is named Christopher Columbus Highway. \u201cYou can\u2019t revise history,\u201d said State Senator Joseph Pennacchio, a Republican who has been a vocal supporter of retaining the Columbus Day holiday and statues honoring the controversial explorer. Though Columbus, who is thought to have been born in Genoa, Italy, but sailed for Spain, is often credited with discovering America, he never actually set foot on the continental United States. Millions of people were already living in North America in 1492 and those opposed to naming the holiday in Columbus\u2019s honor note that his journey encouraged centuries of exploitation of Native Americans. Dr. Wilson said that Columbus\u2019s significant contributions to exploration and trade should be taught alongside his role in enslaving original inhabitants of the islands he colonized.\n\n\u201cI think we don\u2019t understand the true Columbus because we never did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe learned the poem and we never went beyond that.\u201d In 1990, South Dakota became the first state to rename the holiday Native American Day. At least five other states and 130 cities and towns have since renamed the holiday in honor of Indigenous people, and governors of several other states have issued executive orders that remove Columbus Day from state calendars. In New Jersey, Newark and Princeton observe Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day but a statewide effort last year to rename Columbus Day collapsed; New York City still holds the largest Columbus Day parade in the country. In October 2019, as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, marched in the parade, Native Americans gathered for a two-day celebration on Randalls Island. A similar Indigenous Peoples Day in New York City is scheduled for October, in a year that also saw the country\u2019s first Native American appointed to a Cabinet-level agency. Deb Haaland, a congressional representative from New Mexico and a Laguna Pueblo citizen, took over the Interior Department in March. It is unclear what will be decided on Monday when the Randolph school board meets. The resolution under consideration states, in part, that the district will revert to the school calendar \u201cas it existed prior to the board\u2019s May 13, 2021, meeting,\u201d and add any additional state and federal holidays that had not been listed. On Friday, for example, New Jersey will recognize Juneteenth as a holiday for the first time, in commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States.",

Last month, New York City, which operates the country\u2019s largest school system, faced criticism after initially trying to rename Columbus Day for Indigenous people. The convoluted back-and-forth in Randolph may itself be harmful to students\u2019 understanding of Columbus\u2019s role in history, the treatment of Native Americans and the origins of the holiday, said Leslie Wilson, a professor of history at Montclair State University in New Jersey who has spoken on panels about renaming Columbus Day. In New Jersey, Newark and Princeton observe Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day but a statewide effort last year to rename Columbus Day collapsed; New York City still holds the largest Columbus Day parade in the country.",

            "content": "Comedian Joe Piscopo on Wednesday slammed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and city officials for removing Columbus Day from the schools\u2019 calendar, saying that Italian Americans will \"fight tooth and nail\" to have it restored.\n\nPiscopo\u2019s comments came after the city Department of Education put out a new calendar last week, referring to October 11 \u2013 which has historically been \"Columbus Day\" \u2013 as \"Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\"\n\nAmid an initial pushback, the calendar was updated to say \"Italian Heritage Day/Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re very upset that Mayor de Blasio is taking away Columbus Day in New York City schools,\" Piscopo told Fox News in an interview.\n\nEarlier Wednesday Italian-American heritage groups, including the Columbus Citizens Foundation, the Order of Sons of Italy in America, and the Italian American Coalition, among others, held a rally at Columbus Circle to demand that de Blasio reinstate \"Columbus Day.\"\n\n\"We worked so hard to get here as Italian-Americans,\" Piscopo, who was at the rally, told Fox News. \"Now they want to take [Columbus Day] away. And we\u2019re fighting that tooth and nail and are not going to let that happen.\"\n\nColumbus Day has been celebrated in the United States in some capacity since the 18th century. After a high-profile lynching of 11 Italians in New Orleans in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison encouraged Americans to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019 voyage. Then in 1937, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day as a national holiday.\n\nFor decades the holiday has stoked controversy. Indigenous groups have argued that day pinpoints the beginning of the colonization of the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nPiscopo, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy, said that for Italians, especially those living in New Jersey and New York, Columbus Day represents not just one man, but Italian Americans\u2019 heritage.\n\n\"They\u2019re trying to just eliminate it. And [we\u2019ve] never been respected as Italians. So now we\u2019re putting our foot down and we drew a line in the sand and we will have a holiday. We\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus Day. And we\u2019re going to have the biggest parade we\u2019ve ever had.\"\n\nPiscopo clarified that he, and the groups who participated in Wednesday\u2019s rally \"celebrate all ethnicities because that is the foundation of America.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m outside of Newark, New Jersey. There\u2019s every walk of life you could possibly imagine,\" he said. \"And that is the strength of America. The Italians are part of that and we don\u2019t want to take it away.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News has reached out to de Blasio\u2019s office with a request for comment but did not hear back before publication.",

Earlier Wednesday Italian-American heritage groups, including the Columbus Citizens Foundation, the Order of Sons of Italy in America, and the Italian American Coalition, among others, held a rally at Columbus Circle to demand that de Blasio reinstate \"Columbus Day.\"\n\n\"We worked so hard to get here as Italian-Americans,\" Piscopo, who was at the rally, told Fox News. \n\nPiscopo, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy, said that for Italians, especially those living in New Jersey and New York, Columbus Day represents not just one man, but Italian Americans\u2019 heritage.",

            "content": "Residents of one Raleigh, North Carolina, neighborhood awoke Tuesday to news that a zebra cobra snake was on the loose.\n\nThe zebra cobra is not indigenous to the state; in fact, it's not even indigenous to the country. Zebra cobras originate from Africa, according to the African Snake Bite Institute. The snake is usually shy and will choose to escape, although if it is cornered, it will quickly bite or spit. Its venom can cause tissue damage or even death, according to the institute.\n\nThe zebra cobra is nocturnal and has black vertical stripes. It often has a dark black or brown head.\n\nResidents of the neighborhood told WRAL-TV that they had no clue one of their neighbors was keeping a zebra cobra as a pet. They said they were especially concerned for their children and pets.\n\nHow can you tell if a snake is venomous?:Fact check: You can't always tell whether a snake is venomous by how it swims\n\n\"It is pretty alarming,\" Mark Pavlic, who lives there in the neighborhood, told WRAL. \"It seems like a pretty dangerous snake, and dogs like to sniff in the grass and check things out. It's an extreme worry.\"\n\nAccording to North Carolina state law, as long as the owner keeps the reptile in an escape-proof enclosure, it\u2019s not illegal to be in possession of a venomous snake. The law says the owner must have an escape if the animal escapes, including the location of a suitable antivenin.\n\nPolice advised residents to call 911 if they see the snake.",

            "content": "The Chihuahuan Desert in the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. The Wix\u00e1ritari, an Indigenous group, return here every year to collect peyote.Credit...\n\nDrug tourists, mining companies and farming encroachment are threatening the Wix\u00e1rika people\u2019s annual hunt for the psychedelic plant in the Mexican desert.\n\nThe Chihuahuan Desert in the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. The Wix\u00e1ritari, an Indigenous group, return here every year to collect peyote.\n\nMario Bautista was digging relentlessly at the ground. Deep in the vast and unforgiving Chihuahuan Desert, in northeastern Mexico, he had spent nearly eight hours wading through a seemingly endless patch of thorny brush. Surrounding him were 25 members of his community, including his wife and children. Everyone in the group was searching for one thing: the psychedelic plant known as peyote, or hikuri \u2014 a small, squishy cactus camouflaged underneath the shrubbery.\n\nSpread across the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental range, the Wix\u00e1rika are an Indigenous people with an estimated population of 45,000. Within their culture, peyote is far more than just a hallucinogenic cactus. The Wix\u00e1rika believe that the plant allows them to connect with their ancestors and regenerates their souls. Every year, Wix\u00e1rika communities make a several-hundred-mile pilgrimage to a sacred place called Wirikuta, near the northeastern city of Matehuala. Groups travel \u2014 these days by car, trucks and buses \u2014 under the direction of a leading shaman, or maraka\u2019ame. Under Mexican law, only Indigenous groups are authorized to harvest and ingest peyote. But in part because of its increasing popularity as a recreational drug, the plant has become harder to find. If their holy lands continue to be threatened \u2014 by drug tourists, mining companies and farming encroachment \u2014 then a core aspect of the Wix\u00e1rika\u2019s identity will be in danger.\n\nPilgrims are divided into groups based on their ancestral family lands, and each group can only access a particular area within Wirikuta. They must also receive an initial blessing in their homeland before setting out on the journey; for Mario\u2019s family, the blessing took place in Rancho La Tristeza, near the village of La Cebolleta, in the Mexican state of Nayarit. The next day, the group embarked on the pilgrimage adorned in their traditional dress. The women wore vibrant colored, hand-sewn dresses. Scarves protected their hair from the sun.\n\nThe pilgrims also underwent a public confession around midnight, during which each person listed all their past and present sexual relationships. The names were then publicly read around the bonfire; the intention was to let go of the past. Each of the relationships was tied as a knot on individual palm branches. The branches were then burned in the fire.\n\nThroughout the trek, pilgrims made offerings at sacred sites \u2014 areas where their ancestors had found water during previous pilgrimages. Water was key to the offerings; pilgrims used feathers and candles to sprinkle water over the offerings, which included corn tortillas and coins. Families congregated by the watering hole, where they chanted, sang and blessed one another. A fiddler played a joyful tune in the background. After traveling overland for a week, we finally reached our area, known as Bernalejos. \u201cIt is the largest church in the world,\u201d Mario proclaimed as we stepped into the desert. The families rested for a while, but there was no time to sleep. Instead, the pilgrims stayed up to sing and dance for a good harvest.\n\nThe morning of the harvest, families painted their faces with single yellow dots on both cheeks. Mariana, Mario\u2019s wife, explained that the paintings symbolized the sun. In a beautiful formation, the community marched into the morning sunlight with machetes and baskets. Everyone stayed together at first, but gradually the families spread apart. The harvest took hours and became increasingly difficult as the sun grew less forgiving. The largest peyote patches sat beneath shrubs covered in thorns; reaching them was treacherous, particularly in the heat of the day, when the colors seemed to blend together. Still, the hunt continued. Mario explained that they were collecting peyote not only for themselves, but also for family members who could not make the journey. During the forage, each family had gathered up to 150 crowns, after which the plants were dried and blessed.",

            "content": "Combining in-person screenings and virtual events, the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival returns to the TCL Chinese Theatres in Hollywood this week. The curated lineup features heavyweight Latino titles including a special presentation of the highly anticipated musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d based on Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes\u2019 stage show, and \u201cRita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It,\u201d a heartfelt documentary about the Puerto Rican icon.\n\nPutting forward one of its strongest programs since reemerging in 2018 after a long hiatus, the less conspicuous gems at LALIFF include unique stories from Latin America focused on Afro Latinos and Indigenous populations, as well as a variety of titles by American Latinos that include always topical immigration yarns as well as unexpected genre offerings.\n\nAs the festival is composed of nearly 20 features and two dozen shorts, navigating everything at the public\u2019s disposal might be a challenge, so we are highlighting seven thematically varied movies not to miss. LALIFF runs Wednesday through Sunday.\n\nThis singularly intersectional adoption story from Colombia follows Camilo, a young Black man raised in the Quillacinga Indigenous reservation near the Cocha Lagoon. Although he had always felt part of the community and followed its rules and traditions, as an adult he yearns to find his biological mother for a sense of direct connection. In the documentary, director Viviana G\u00f3mez Echeverry examines, with a keenly observational eye, Camilo\u2019s troubled state of mind as his loving adoptive parents support his search for identity. Interwoven in the same arc are the Indigenous people\u2019s efforts to maintain sovereignty over their land and resources amid the government\u2019s plan to privatize them for tourism purposes.\n\nVenezuelan-born, Miami-based writer, director and star Maria Corina Ramirez transfigures her personal accounts into a contemplative debut feature about an undocumented high school student uncertain about her future in the U.S. This is the rare film that deploys voice-over not as narration but to lace the images with introspective poetry as the protagonist debates what to share with the world in her valedictorian speech. Ramirez\u2019s understated performance and supporting narrative choices resonate with humble determination. They come from lived-in knowledge and a talent to present those experiences gracefully in each scene. \u201cBridges\u201d is one of the most accurate film portrayals of what immigrant youths withstand in this country.\n\nA dystopian drama that conveys the racial inequity rampant in Latin America, actor L\u00e1zaro Ramos\u2019 first feature film as a writer-director is a searing and frightening fiction. Within this alternate world, Black individuals in Brazil are referred to as \u201chigh-melanin citizens.\u201d The racist government, unwilling to address the horrors of slavery and pay reparations, passes a measure that will deport all Black Brazilians to the African continent. Through dynamic sequences that sharply exploit this heightened realm to express the films\u2019 ideas, Ramos firmly tackles the complex plight of Afro Latinos. The subject is alarmingly relevant in the U.S., where the Republican Party has prioritized banning critical race theory in an effort to perpetuate an untruthful status quo.\n\nMeticulously researched, this portrait of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria goes beyond examining the infuriating neglect of the island by the United States government in a time of crisis to paint an expansive picture of the neocolonial practices that have devastated its economy. Brilliant documentarian Cecilia Aldarondo traveled to nearly every corner of the territory to contrast the conditions of locals \u2014 defined by uncertainty, scarcity and resilience \u2014 with the opportunistic vision that voracious outsiders have for what they see as a profitable tax haven. Archival footage reminds us that, both now and decades ago, foreign plans for so-called improvement never have Boricuas in mind.\n\n\u2018My Heart Can\u2019t Beat Unless You Tell It To\u2019\n\nAlong the lines of great modern vampire films such as \u201cLet the Right One In\u201d and \u201cOnly Lovers Left Alive,\u201d this eerie horror drama centers on three siblings trapped in a disturbing lifestyle. Hesitant but loyal, Dwight (Patrick Fugit) is tasked with hunting prey to feed his pallid younger brother, Thomas (Owen Campbell), who is allergic to the sun and awake only at night. Fed up with such a dark existence, Dwight wishes to escape their strict sister, Jesse (Ingrid Sophie Schram). Subdued in its approach to well-trodden tropes, director Jonathan Cuartas\u2019 genre offering grounds the myth in an urban reality thanks to the cast\u2019s fittingly muted acting.\n\nThree women grapple with a distinct aspect of their sexuality in a fascinating multi-narrative plot that unfurls over the course of two days in San Mateo, an Indigenous Mixtec small town. The astutely penned social drama from Mexican writer-director \u00c1ngeles Cruz, a Mixtec woman herself, addresses the patriarchal systems that hinder women\u2019s most intimate choices, as well as the effects of economic hardship that force individuals in rural areas to migrate to urban centers. Cruz guides the ensemble cast, which includes prolific actor No\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, to superbly nuanced interactions often underlined with a sorrowful mood. Her stellar work joins a much-needed wave of Indigenous stories and storytellers in Mexican cinema in recent years.\n\nIn her best lead role to date, and a bilingual one to boot, Chilean actress Lorenza Izzo (\u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\u201d) commands this tragicomedy set across the late 1960s and early \u201970s. As Celina, a single mother in San Francisco, she explores the institutionalized sexism and social stigmatization that prevent women from achieving their professional goals and taking charge of their reproductive health. Breaking the fourth wall and often providing historical context, which is admittedly a bit obvious at times, director Lissette Feliciano presents a lively and poignant tribute to womanhood. The unapologetically Latinx movie, which is LALIFF\u2019s closing-night presentation, takes its name from Janis Joplin\u2019s 1967 song.",

            "description": "How Brazil's fear of losing the Amazon guides Bolsonaro's policies towards the forest  CNN International",
            "content": "(CNN) In 2000, when the internet in Brazil was still in its infancy, an email with an alarming message about the Amazon went viral. It claimed that the United States and the United Nations had taken the forest from Brazilians and transformed it into a protected area -- a falsehood, but one that reflected a long-running conspiracy theory still promoted today by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe email described a purported geography textbook being used in \"important American schools,\" which labeled the Amazon as an \"international control zone.\" Next to a map, a misspelled text said that the forest was \"surrounded by irresponsable, cruel, and authoritary countries\" and that the United States and the United Nations, with the backing of the \"G23,\" transformed it into \"an international park with very severe rules of exploration.\"\n\n\"The value of this area is unable to calcule,\" it continued, \"but the planet can be cert that The United States won't let these Latin American countries explorate and destroy this real ownership of all humanity.\"\n\nDespite the multiple signs that the textbook was fake -- the writing was riddled with mistakes, the map looked doctored, and the obvious fact that the Amazon had not been turned into an international reserve -- the rumor touched a chord with Brazilians, circulating so widely that both the Brazilian embassy in Washington and the American embassy in Bras\u00edlia tried to debunk it. \"The idea is so hilarious that I feel silly to have to talk about it,\" Anthony Harrington, the American ambassador in Brazil, said at the time, according to news website G1.\n\nBut the viral image also illustrates a pervasive fear that grips Brazil and that has profound consequences for the forest.\n\nIn May 2018, during his campaign for president, President Bolsonaro hinted at the conspiracy theory: \"The Amazon is not ours,\" he claimed. \"I say that with a lot of sadness, but it is a reality.\" Later that year, after being elected but before taking office, he threatened to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, claiming that it weakened Brazilian control over the Amazon.\n\nAnd in April 2019, already in power, he spoke openly about a murky plot to steal the forest from Brazil that involved the creation of indigenous reserves. \"If we don't change our policies, we will lose the Amazon,\" he said in a radio interview with Jovem Pan. \"The United Nations has been discussing, for a while now, that through the auto-determination of indigenous peoples, you could have new countries here inside,\" he added. \"That could happen.\"\n\nA fear with roots in the military\n\nFears of foreign meddling in the Amazon are not entirely unfounded. Two years ago, Stephen Walt, a respected professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote an article for Foreign Policy, a respected publication on international politics, titled \"Who Will Invade Brazil to Save the Amazon?\" The title, which the scholar said on Twitter had not been written by him, was later softened to \"Who Will Save the Amazon (and How)?\"\n\nWalt's article started with a hypothetical description of an American president ordering an invasion of Brazil due to environmental breaches. \"The president's decision came in the aftermath of a new United Nations report cataloging the catastrophic global effects of continued rainforest destruction,\" Walt fantasized. It continued with a discussion of the merits of that move, including the international mechanisms and historical precedents that would allow it to happen.\n\nIt is also true that foreign leaders have repeatedly made statements that could be perceived as questioning Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon. They include former vice president Al Gore, then a senator, (\"Contrary to what Brazilians think, the Amazon is not their property, it belongs to all of us\"), then French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (Brazil should accept a \"relative sovereignty\" over the forest), and then British prime minister John Major (who threatened military action to expand the rule of law \"over what is common to all in the world\").\n\nBut as with other conspiracies, that germ of truth has been extrapolated into absurdity. The rumor about the textbooks is a good example of that. It actually started in the armed forces, as a short text in a small independent website kept by retired military officers in Brazil, according to a dossier compiled by Paulo Roberto de Almeida, a diplomat at the embassy in Washington in the early 2000s, when the email went viral for the first time.\n\nThe title of the website -- \"Brazil, Love It or Leave It\" -- is a slogan of the military dictatorship, and its content is nationalistic. Its stated goal is to fight disinformation, but it actually features a multitude of conspiracies, many referring to the Amazon.\n\nThe authors of the website see foreign leaders' disparaging remarks about Brazil's guardianship of the Amazon as attempts to weaken Brazilian sovereignty over the forest, and as a means to open it for interference, exploitation, and invasion.\n\nOne article claims that a reserve granted to an indigenous group was a \"nation within the nation\" with covert separatist intentions. Another claims that an \"ecologist hysteria,\" fueled by foreign-sponsored activists and journalists, were part of a plot to internationalize the Amazon, \"taking away from Brazil the right to use its wealth.\"\n\n\"We are undergoing a process in our country that is beyond logic,\" the authors of the website explain in an editorial. Rich countries are using globalization, environmentalism, and humanitarianism to force poor nations to open their markets, politics, and territories to foreign interference. Brazil is failing to fight that invasion, the editorial claims. \"A full opening is underway,\" and the forest is central to that process.\n\nThe authors, whose full names are not displayed on the website, did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nTo defend, but not to protect\n\nPresident Bolsonaro, a military man himself, is no stranger to such fears of encroachment on Brazilian sovereignty. Since he reached power two years ago, he seems to have been fighting some of the internal enemies identified by the creators of the rumor about the textbook -- indigenous peoples and environmental groups.\n\nNot a single indigenous reservation was created during his first two years in power, a considerable drop compared to predecessors. Right-wing president Fernando Henrique Cardoso approved an average of 36 indigenous reservations every two years during his presidency in the 1990s. Left-wing president Lula da Silva approved an average of 22 per two years. Now, approvals of indigenous reservations have fallen to zero, according to newspaper O Globo.\n\nThe Bolsonaro administration has also frozen some state funding that supports environmental groups, a move that O Globo described as \"a declaration of war on NGOs.\" Bolsonaro later claimed that environmental organizations were setting fires to the Amazon, recording them, and sending the images abroad to make him look bad to international audiences.\n\nThe president has also aimed fiery statements at the foreign enemies supposedly plotting a takeover of the Amazon in collusion with international organizations.\n\n\"We saw recently a great candidate for head of state say that if I don't put out the fire in the Amazon, he will put up commercial barriers against Brazil,\" he said in 2020, referring to comments made by Joe Biden during a presidential debate.\n\n\"How can we deal with all that? Just diplomacy is not enough,\" he said. \"When saliva runs out, one has to have gunpowder.\"\n\nIn August 2019, following an infamous fire season in the Amazon, French President Emmanuel Macron tried to pressure Brazil into improving environmental protections. \"Our house is burning,\" he tweeted ahead of the 2019 G7 summit, urging his fellow leaders to discuss the \"emergency.\" During the summit, he made a reference to Brazilian control of the forest. \"The Amazon forest is a subject for the whole planet,\" he said. \"We respect your sovereignty\", he added, \"but we cannot allow you to destroy everything.\"\n\nThe following month, during a meeting with presidents of South American countries that include portions of the Amazon, President Bolsonaro criticized Macron's remarks, making clear that he saw in them a potential plan to wrest the vast forest from Brazil. \"A plan to turn this large area into a world heritage site is still on the table,\" he said at the time.\n\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque, the host of the meeting, said Amazon states needed to better coordinate their actions to stop the cutting and burning of trees. Ecuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno sang a song about environmental preservation. Bolsonaro, meanwhile, insisted that the summit's final declaration mention sovereignty.\n\n\"We have to say that the Amazon is ours,\" he said. \"We have to take a firm position in defense of our sovereignty, so that each country can, within its land, develop the best policy for the region, and not let that this policy be dealt with by other countries.\"\n\nThe Brazilian President's fears of a foreign takeover of the Amazon might be irrelevant if they did not pose a material effect on the forest itself.\n\nIf history is any indication, the effect might be catastrophic. The Amazon was a central concern of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil between the 1960s and 1980s. The officers in power believed that the region was highly vulnerable to foreign interference, being too vast, too isolated, and too precious for its own good. They tried to end that vulnerability by encouraging people to move there, stimulating agriculture, ranching, and mining, paving the forest with highways, and building ports, mines, refineries, and dams. These initiatives were devastating, and deforestation spiked in the period between 1965 and 1985.\n\nIn early 2019, the Bolsonaro administration sketched an ambitious development project guided by similar ideas. The Baron Rio Branco Plan, created by retired military general Maynard Marques de Santa Rosa, then a member of the administration, aimed at building a dam and a bridge over two Amazon rivers, expanding an existing highway all the way to Suriname, and incentivizing mining and farming. Indigenous peoples and environmental groups issued statements repudiating the project, in part because the expanded highway would pass through multiple areas of protected forest.\n\nIn late 2019, Santa Rosa left the government and the plan lost strength, but specific parts, like the highway, are still planned by the government and could still become a reality.\n\nIn trying to protect the forest from imaginary enemies, the President leaves it vulnerable to perhaps its greatest threat: himself.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWhen the nation\u2019s foremost museum got serious about the nation\u2019s first inhabitants, they needed an Indigenous lodestar. They found one in Norby, its first curator of Native American art.\n\nBig, bold and by many accounts about time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s 56-word land-acknowledgment plaque, placed on its Fifth Avenue facade in May, honors the Indigenous peoples past and present (principally the Lenape) whose homeland the institution occupies. Visitors to the Met, or the Art Institute of Chicago, or any of the other museums where land acknowledgments greet them, may well wonder how these sentiments, crafted with extreme care and usually in consultation with Indigenous communities, fit with galleries containing some two centuries of art depicting Native Americans as occasionally brave, sometimes demonic and most often doomed. Not to mention their proximity to many art historical celebrations of Manifest Destiny in landscapes by Alfred Bierstadt, Thomas Moran and others. This is difficult terrain and the Met has been both staunch and cautious in charting it: the bronze plaque was years in coming, while the murals by Kent Monkman, a Canadian artist of Cree descent, that greeted visitors in the Great Hall from 2019 through April, were an audacious recent commission, offering witty references to celebrated works in the museum\u2019s collection.\n\nWhen she isn\u2019t at the Met, Norby, 50, is in rural Wisconsin on a six-acre farm with her husband, a veterinarian, and their teenage daughter. They hunt, grow much of what they eat, and nearby there is a community of Native women from whom she has learned many techniques of beading and regalia-making. In her leisure time, you are as likely to find her playing the banjo or listening to the Carolina Chocolate Drops, the African American string band, as reading a text on tribal sovereignty. Her credentials include a Ph.D. in American Studies from the University of Minnesota with a concentration in American Indian History, Art and Visual Culture, as well as a forthcoming book, \u201cWater, Bones, and Bombs,\u201d on art making and environmental issues in New Mexico\u2019s Rio Grande Valley. She has held positions at the Newberry Library in Chicago and the National Museum of the American Indian in New York, won numerous awards and done focused work on the deaccessioning and repatriation of cultural material. For all of her learning, Norby is less academic in her approach to art than many curators, preferring to talk about how her M.F.A. in printmaking and photography informs her curatorial work. \u201cI\u2019m interested in what goes into making something \u2014 the physical and emotional toll. I\u2019m not interested in which artist is hot,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to see things that are deeply connected to aesthetic protocols but have something new and fresh in them as well.\u201d That passion is on view from the moment you enter the new rotation of \u201cArt of Native America.\u201d The map that initially greeted visitors demarking nine Native American cultural areas \u2014 Woodlands, Plains, Plateau, and so forth \u2014 is gone. \u201cThere are distinct homelands,\u201d Norby acknowledges, \u201cbut there was much more exchange than maps can communicate, and, anyway, maps are settler ideas of Indigenous cultures.\u201d\n\nInstead visitors will encounter two contemporary works: \u201cUntitled (Dream Catcher)\u201d from 2014 by Marie Watt (Seneca), a huge assemblage of reclaimed blankets quilted by many hands into a patchwork of Indigenous stories. It sets the stage for the rest of the exhibition, as does the Northern traditional dance dress and accessories (2005) across from it, created by Jodi Archambault (Lakota) with family and friends that features 15 pounds of beads and was worn in powwow dance competitions. The spirit of community and the continuity of past and present are unmistakable in both pieces, and are unmistakably part of the way Norby, along with Sylvia Yount, curator in charge of the American Wing, have done this reinstallation of the Diker material. Although still arranged geographically, the 116 works from more than 50 cultures have been reduced to 89, of which 29 are recent additions from the Dikers and others. In addition to putting historic work in conversation with some contemporary pieces, there is an invigorating change in the most routine aspect of museum exhibitions, the wall label. Many of the labels have been adjusted or replaced with texts by artists and scholars from the source communities, erasing, for the most part, the customary hierarchy in which museum curators speak for the art and to the visitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a visitor here myself,\u201d Norby says, explaining why it is not her place to talk about another community\u2019s work, and why it is important to turn to living people to not only speak about an object but to help to dispel the aura of nostalgia that clouds our vision of Native Americans. There will be other rotations of the collection, Norby promises; perhaps one where works are put in conversation with non-Native art. The possibilities are many, but she assures me that the participation of source communities will increase with each new installation. Will there also be more Native visitors, as there were when she was at the Newberry in Chicago? \u201cIt takes time,\u201d she says,\u201d but I have something I like to call \u2018Indians attract Indians.\u2019 We always seem to find each other.\u201d\n\nAs we pass through the Engelhard Court on our way to \u201cArt of Native America\u201d I pause by Saint-Gaudens\u2019s statue of a doomed and defeated Hiawatha, expecting a caustic remark or two from her about this routine bit of colonialist depiction. Instead, she surveys the court and says, \u201cThayer Tolles does such a good job here,\u201d referring to the Wing\u2019s curator of American paintings and sculpture. She goes on to express her pleasure in working with a staff of all female curators. Norby is aware that she has arrived at an auspicious time, as the American Wing has been remaking itself under Yount. Founded in 1924 in the boosterish spirit of the colonial revival, it has come a long way since period rooms and Pilgrim furniture ruled the day and Native art was shown elsewhere \u2014 in the Rockefeller Wing with the arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. Since 2018, works by Frederic Remington, Henry Inman, Augustus Saint-Gaudens and many others have also had, in addition to their traditional wall labels, a rotating set of what the Met calls \u201cNative Perspectives\u201d by contemporary artists and scholars. Native art has also been installed here and there in the Wing\u2019s paintings galleries. When Norby expands the presence of contemporary Native art in the American Wing, she will have gone some distance toward erasing another boundary \u2014 the longstanding, peculiar, four-block separation between late modern and contemporary American art and the American Wing\u2019s mid-17th to early 20th century art. And if she then shows Native art in other departmental galleries, something she is eager to do, she will also have begun to realign the museum itself with the new bronze plaque on its facade.

Visitors to the Met, or the Art Institute of Chicago, or any of the other museums where land acknowledgments greet them, may well wonder how these sentiments, crafted with extreme care and usually in consultation with Indigenous communities, fit with galleries containing some two centuries of art depicting Native Americans as occasionally brave, sometimes demonic and most often doomed. Founded in 1924 in the boosterish spirit of the colonial revival, it has come a long way since period rooms and Pilgrim furniture ruled the day and Native art was shown elsewhere \u2014 in the Rockefeller Wing with the arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. When Norby expands the presence of contemporary Native art in the American Wing, she will have gone some distance toward erasing another boundary \u2014 the longstanding, peculiar, four-block separation between late modern and contemporary American art and the American Wing\u2019s mid-17th to early 20th century art.",

On June 25, the city council voted to change the road\u2019s name to Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive. It\u2019s one of a number of moves in U.S. cities to rename streets over the last year in recognition of Black historical figures.\n\nChicago\u2019s new street moniker recognizes Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, a Haitian-born Black pioneer and trader who was the first non-Indigenous settler of what is now the third-largest U.S. city. The notion of renaming Lake Shore Drive in his honor dates back years, and the push to honor him in other public spaces goes back decades to the 1980s administration of Harold Washington, Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFive articles from around The Times, narrated just for you.\n\nQueens Hustles Back to Life and Hawaii\u2019s Proud Surfers: The Week in Narrated Articles\n\nA vibrant energy seems to have returned to the cluster of neighborhoods in north central Queens that became the first epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States. But beneath the bustle lies desperation. Vendors, whose broad array of street food reflects the area\u2019s diversity, often have lost steady jobs and do not know how else to make money. Residents and many business owners have fallen far behind on rent. Food pantry lines remain long. \u201cThe beauty of what we see is that the immigrant community always finds a way to get by,\u201d said Francisco Moya, a local Democratic city councilman. \u201cWhat you see on Roosevelt Avenue \u2014 it\u2019s survival.\u201d\n\nIn surfing, there is an understanding: You represent Hawaii, or you represent the United States. You do not do both. The simplest reason is that Hawaii is the birthplace of surfing and remains the sport\u2019s cultural heart. But when surfing makes its debut at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, there will be no such delineation. Hawaii will disappear as a separate surfing entity. Some surfers are eager to avoid politics, but it is impossible to ignore the historical and cultural waves churning around them. Old debates have flared in recent years, over appropriation and independence, over colonization and commercialization, over how to protect what it means to be Hawaiian, or from Hawaii.\n\nThe Maori were the first to reach Antarctica, in the seventh century. A recent study looks ahead, proposing an Indigenous framework to manage and conserve the southernmost continent. The authors hope to apply to Antarctica the Maori principle of kaitiakitanga, the concept of guardianship and stewardship of the environment. Their suggestions include getting more Indigenous voices in Antarctic governance and granting Antarctica legal personhood. \u2018Sermongate\u2019 Prompts a Quandary: Should Pastors Borrow Words From One Another?\n\nA video comparing two sermons has racked up thousands of views online in recent days, partly because the two men are not just any church leaders: The first, who delivered his sermon in 2019, is J.D. Greear, the departing president of the Southern Baptist Convention. The other is Ed Litton, who was elected as Mr. Greear\u2019s successor just a couple of weeks ago by a thin margin at an unusually contentious meeting.",

            "description": "Haunani-Kay Trask, Champion of Native Rights in Hawaii, Dies at 71  The New York Times",
            "content": "Haunani-Kay Trask in an undated photo. As a professor, poet and activist, she pushed for the recognition of Hawaii\u2019s Indigenous people. \u201cI am not soft, I am not sweet, and I do not want any more tourists in Hawaii,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nShe helped found the field of Hawaiian studies and pressed for Indigenous sovereignty. \u201cWe will die as Hawaiians,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will never be Americans.\u201d\n\nHaunani-Kay Trask, a scholar, poet and champion of sovereignty for the Hawaiian people who decried what she called the colonization and despoliation of her native land, died on July 3 in Honolulu. She was 71. The cause was cancer, her partner, David E. Stannard, said. In her best-known book, \u201cNotes From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in Hawaii\u201d (1993), Dr. Trask called Hawaii \u201conce the most fragile and precious of sacred places, now transformed by the American behemoth into a dying land.\u201d Dr. Trask was not afraid to make waves as a leader of what became known as the Hawaiian Sovereignty movement. She received national attention in 1990 for remarks directed at an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii, where she was a professor of Hawaiian studies. The student, in a letter to the school newspaper, accused Native Hawaiians of holding racist attitudes toward white people on the island. Dr. Trask responded that the student \u201cdoes not understand racism at all\u201d and should leave Hawaii \u2014 which he did, returning to his home state, Louisiana, for a time, The New York Times reported. When some students and faculty members criticized Dr. Trask\u2019s comments as unnecessarily harsh, she answered: \u201cI am a nationalist. I am asserting my claim to my country.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI am not soft, I am not sweet, and I do not want any more tourists in Hawaii.\u201d With her sister Mililani B. Trask, Dr. Trask was a founding member of Ka Lahui Hawaii, an organization that promotes self-determination for Native Hawaiians, which held its first convention in 1987. She believed, as she wrote in \u201cNotes From a Native Daughter,\u201d that \u201cthe secrets of the land die with the people of the land,\u201d and thus that preservation of Indigenous lands should be paramount. In 1993, she helped lead a march of Native Hawaiians, known as Kanaka Maoli, who were seeking to reclaim lands held in trust by the state. The march, one of the first major protests calling for a return of native lands in Hawaii, took place on the centennial of the overthrow of its last queen, Liliuokalani. Ka Lahui demanded that the territory be ceded to it, after it had drawn up a constitution for Hawaiian self-government along the lines of the \u201cnation within a nation\u201d model found in American Indian tribal lands. Bills were introduced in the state Legislature, but they failed to pass. At the march, Dr. Trask took to the podium in front of Honolulu\u2019s Iolani Palace and proclaimed: \u201cWe are not American. We will die as Hawaiians. We will never be Americans.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe Americans, my people, are our enemies, and you must understand that. They are our enemies. They took our land, they imprisoned our queen, they banned our language, they forcibly made us a colony of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cFrom a Native Daughter,\u201d her books include \u201cEros and Power: The Promise of Feminist Theory\u201d (1981), which was adapted from her dissertation, and two poetry collections, \u201cLight in the Crevice Never Seen\u201d (1994) and \u201cNight Is a Sharkskin Drum\u201d (2002). Dr. Trask\u2019s poetry employed imagery suggestive of a sentient island bleeding from the violence of colonialism. In one poem, \u201cColonization,\u201d she wrote: She also railed against the tourism industry, in her poetry as well as her academic work. She challenged its marketing of the Hawaiian islands as an acquiescent paradise, a depiction that she felt ignored the history of violence against the land and its Native inhabitants. Hawaii is a racially diverse society: 2019 census data puts the island at about a quarter white, 38 percent Asian, 10 percent Native Hawaiian and another quarter identifying with two or more races. Large numbers of Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; with American annexation of the island in 1898, white settlers came as well. Hawaii became a state in 1959. Dr. Trask was founding director of the University of Hawaii\u2019s Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies, a field she was credited with helping to establish. She retired from the university in 2010. She was considered a pivotal figure in showing \u201cthe importance of critical analysis and creativity to forging a more just future for Indigenous peoples,\u201d the American Academy of Arts and Sciences said in electing her a member this year.\n\n\u201cWhen I meet another Hawaiian,\u201d Dr. Trask wrote of her lineage, \u201cI say I am descended of two genealogical lines: the Piilani line through my mother, who is from Hana, Maui, and the Kahakumakaliua line through my father\u2019s family from Kauai.\u201d She grew up on Oahu, outside Honolulu, along with her five siblings. She graduated from the Kamehameha School in Honolulu, which was established in the late 19th century to educate children of Hawaiian descent. She attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison, earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in political science in 1975 and a doctorate in the same field in 1981. Just after completing her Ph.D., Dr. Trask began teaching at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where she started in the American studies department. Along with Dr. Stannard, her partner since 1980, and her sister Mililani, she is survived by two other sisters, Kahala-Ann Trask Gibson and Damien Onaona Trask, and a brother, Michael. She died in a residential care home. In her speech at the 1993 march in Honolulu, Dr. Trask summed up much of what her life was about when she reminded her fellow protesters why she stood before them, and what drove her on. \u201cI am so proud to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so proud to be angry. I am so proud to be a Hawaiian.\u201d",

She believed, as she wrote in \u201cNotes From a Native Daughter,\u201d that \u201cthe secrets of the land die with the people of the land,\u201d and thus that preservation of Indigenous lands should be paramount. The march, one of the first major protests calling for a return of native lands in Hawaii, took place on the centennial of the overthrow of its last queen, Liliuokalani. Ka Lahui demanded that the territory be ceded to it, after it had drawn up a constitution for Hawaiian self-government along the lines of the \u201cnation within a nation\u201d model found in American Indian tribal lands.",

On boats from Europe,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez said on Wednesday, during a televised appearance next to Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who was visiting Buenos Aires.\n\nThe video of the statement, which Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez said was a quote of the Mexican Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, went viral on social media, generating widespread news coverage as well as a deluge of criticism and astonishment from politicians and ordinary citizens in neighboring Brazil and in Mexico.",

            "content": "Paramedics in Winnipeg, the provincial capital, last year. The province has seen a surge in coronavirus cases recently despite being sparsely populated.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe coronavirus is spreading faster in Manitoba than in any other province or state in Canada, the United States or Mexico, though the premier has resisted new restrictions.\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 Last year the Canadian province of Manitoba seemed to be a model of how to handle a pandemic: Its case numbers were low compared to Europe and the United States, and deaths were rare. But now the coronavirus is spreading faster in Manitoba than in any other province or state in Canada, the United States or Mexico, with Indigenous people and people of color hit disproportionately hard. At a time when Canada\u2019s vaccination program is hitting its stride after a slow rollout, with many provincial governments laying out plans for gradual reopenings into the fall, Manitoba is in crisis mode. Over the past two weeks, the province has reported a daily average of 35 new cases per 100,000 people, far exceeding Canada as a whole, which is averaging about 10. Manitoba has more than twice as many new cases per day than the next-highest state or province.\n\nThe situation is a remarkable reversal. Manitoba once stood out as an example of the effectiveness of tight restrictions, like closing its borders to the rest of Canada, to curb the spread of the virus. Manitoba later eased or lifted many of those restrictions. But as a third wave of infections struck, its premier, Brian Pallister, resisted the restoration of many of them. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from being almost the best-case scenario \u2014 the way to do it right with almost no cases \u2014 to now the worst in North America,\u201d said Mary Agnes Welch, a principal in Probe Research, a polling firm in the provincial capital, Winnipeg. \u201cHow did we get here? There\u2019s a sense of sort-of bafflement about that among Manitobans.\u201d People of Southeast Asian descent, who make up a small portion of Manitoba\u2019s population, are disproportionately affected, with an infection rate of 146 cases per 1,000 people, 13 times the rate among white people. Indigenous people, about 20 percent of the province\u2019s population, are being infected at 1.75 times the rate of white people. Some Indigenous people in Manitoba say that the disparity underscores racism within the health care system and longstanding problems in getting services.\n\nThe surge in Covid-19 cases has overwhelmed intensive care units in Manitoba\u2019s hospitals, forcing some patients to be evacuated by air to other provinces. Twenty-six patients had been flown to neighboring Ontario by midday Thursday, including some to Ottawa, about 1,000 miles away. Saskatchewan was expected to accept its first I.C.U. patients from Manitoba later in the day. On Tuesday, a group of doctors called on the province to follow the lead of Ontario and other provinces by introducing a stay-at-home order and closing nonessential businesses, particularly stores. Those steps have allowed other provinces to rein in their most recent waves of infections. \u201cThe only thing that hasn\u2019t happened really is shutting down areas where people congregate for work,\u201d said Dr. Eric Jacobsohn, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba who is part of the group. \u201cWe saw last year when we had to have a complete shutdown, we got control of the situation.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Pallister extended for another two weeks rules that ban indoor and outdoor gatherings of people who are not from the same household. Health officials were given the power to close businesses with outbreaks, but the government did not elaborate.\n\u2022 Medical professionals urge Spotify to crack down on Covid misinformation.\n\u2022 The C.D.C. conceded that cloth masks do not protect against the virus as effectively as other masks. Stores, including those selling nonessential goods, will be allowed to remain open, while limited to 10 percent of their capacity, a cap imposed several weeks ago. Ontario and other provinces have taken stricter steps. \u201cWe need Manitobans to stay home as much as possible over the next two weeks,\u201d Mr. Pallister said. Mr. Pallister has repeatedly suggested that the worsening situation was caused, not by too few restrictions, but rather by people failing to comply with restrictions already in place. \u201cNo restrictions work unless people work at them,\u201d Mr. Pallister said on Thursday after being asked why he was not shutting nonessential stores.",

            "content": "Mining company Rio Tinto PLC named Peter Cunningham as chief financial officer, making permanent a role the company veteran has held on an interim basis since Jan 1.\n\nRio Tinto elevated Mr. Cunningham to the interim CFO role as part of a broader executive reshuffling that came after the company destroyed the ancient Juukan Gorge rock shelters in northwestern Australia last year. The London-listed company in December named former CFO Jakob Stausholm as chief executive, succeeding Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques, who stepped down after about four years amid pushback from investors. Other executives, including the head of the company\u2019s iron-ore business, also resigned.\n\nRio Tinto, which didn\u2019t break any laws when destroying the site, has apologized. A government inquiry recommended the company compensate the indigenous landowners and found failings in laws designed to protect indigenous heritage. Rio Tinto has said it is working with the landowners on a remedy and is assessing ways to protect the area.\n\nMr. Cunningham, who has worked at Rio Tinto for 28 years, previously served as its corporate controller. He has also served as head of its health, safety, environment and communities division, as well as head of energy and climate strategy, the company said in a press release.\n\n\u201cHis detailed knowledge of the company and of the financial and non-financial drivers of our industry will be invaluable as we continue to strengthen Rio Tinto,\u201d Mr. Stausholm, the company\u2019s CEO, said in the release.\n\nMr. Cunningham steps into his role amid surging commodity prices as countries around the world are lifting pandemic restrictions and companies are facing supply-chain bottlenecks. Net earnings at Rio Tinto in 2020 were $9.8 billion, up 22% from the previous year.\n\nRecord iron ore prices have bolstered the company\u2019s cash flow in recent months, according to Chris LaFemina, managing director of global metals and mining research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., an investment bank.\n\nMr. Cunningham in his new role will face questions about how much money the company should invest in the business and return to shareholders, Mr. LaFemina said. Rio Tinto had $10.4 billion in cash and equivalents as of Dec. 31, up 29% from a year earlier. The company declared $9 billion in dividends in 2020, up from $7.2 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cIt is a high-class problem to have, but it\u2019s still a challenge. How do you manage all of this cash flow?\u201d Mr. LaFemina said.\n\nIn his new role, Mr. Cunningham will receive a base salary of \u00a3700,000, equivalent to about $973,000, as well as an annual bonus with a target of the same amount, Rio Tinto said in the release. He will also qualify for a long-term incentive worth up to 400% of his base salary, according to the release.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",

            "content": "Mexico has accused fashion brands Zara, Anthropologie and Patowl of cultural appropriation, claiming that they \"made use\" of designs created by the country's indigenous populations.\n\nIn a series of letters written to the brands, Mexico's Ministry of Culture asked for a \"public explanation.\" It also called for \"benefits\" to be \"given back to the creative communities\" that it believes invented the embroidery techniques and design motifs.\n\nIn a press release, the Ministry of Culture took issue with a blue embroidered midi dress by Zara. It claimed the Spanish brand had drawn on the ancestral symbols and traditional \"huipil\" dresses produced by the Mixtec people of San Juan Colorado, Mexico, adding that the dresses typically take craftspeople at least one month to make. The item in question is no longer available for sale on Zara's website.\n\nPatowl's \"casual flowers\" shirts were meanwhile said to have been inspired by the embroidery techniques of the Zapotec community of San Antonino Castillo Velasco. The government alleged the handmade floral embroidery on Patowl's shirts was an imitation of a complex technique known as \"hazme si puedes\" (\"make me if you can\"), and include the community's pansy motifs, among others.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN, Zara's parent company, Inditex, said it had \"the highest respect,\" for \"the Ministry (of Culture) and the communities within Mexico,\" but added that \"the design in question was in no way intentionally borrowed from or influenced by the artistry of the Mixtec people of Mexico.\"\n\nNeither Patowl nor Anthropologie's parent company URBN responded to CNN's request for comment.\n\nIn its press release, the Ministry of Culture said that indigenous communities' \"collective property\" had been \"privatized\" by the brands, calling on them to create an \"ethical framework\" to work directly with its craftspeople.\n\nIt said that it was acting to \"prevent plagiarism ... by national companies and transnationals,\" adding that it was \"protecting the rights of native peoples who have historically been disregarded.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Mexico has accused brands of appropriation. Last November, French designer Isabel Marant apologized after the country's Ministry of Culture claimed her label had used a pattern created by the Purepecha community. Marant offered her \"most sincere apologies,\" according to the BBC , saying that she would \"pay tribute to our sources of inspiration\" in the future.\n\nIn 2019, the ministry also accused American womenswear brand Carolina Herrera of using Mexican patterns \"without permission, without respect, without any economic consideration.\" Though the label did not respond to CNN's request for comment at the time, creative director Wes Gordon said in a statement to the Guardian that the brand had tried to \"highlight the importance of this magnificent cultural heritage\" and was a \"tribute to the richness of Mexican culture.\"",

            "content": "The federal government will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools and work to \"uncover the truth about the loss of human life and the lasting consequences\" of policies that over the decades forced hundreds of thousands of children from their families and communities, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced Tuesday.\n\nThe unprecedented work will include compiling and reviewing records to identify past boarding schools, locate known and possible burial sites at or near those schools, and uncover the names and tribal affiliations of students, she said.\n\n\"To address the intergenerational impact of Indian boarding schools and to promote spiritual and emotional healing in our communities, we must shed light on the unspoken traumas of the past no matter how hard it will be,\" Haaland said.\n\nA member of New Mexico\u2019s Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, Haaland outlined the initiative while addressing members of the National Congress of American Indians during the group\u2019s midyear conference.\n\nShe said the process will be long, difficult and painful and will not undo the heartbreak and loss endured by many families.\n\nStarting with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the U.S. enacted laws and policies to establish and support Indian boarding schools across the nation. For over 150 years, Indigenous children were taken from their communities and forced into boarding schools that focused on assimilation.\n\nHaaland talked about the federal government's attempt to wipe out tribal identity, language and culture and how that past has continued to manifest itself through long-standing trauma, cycles of violence and abuse, premature deaths, mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\nThe recent discovery of children's remains buried at the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school has magnified interest in the troubling legacy both in Canada and the United States.\n\nUS TO GIVE ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO SKIPPED COURT DATE ANOTHER SHOT\n\nIn Canada, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and were not allowed to speak their languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nAfter reading about the unmarked graves in Canada, Haaland recounted her own family's story in a recent opinion piece published by the Washington Post.\n\nHaaland cited statistics from the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which reported that by 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations. Besides providing resources and raising awareness, the coalition has been working to compile additional research on U.S. boarding schools and deaths that many say is sorely lacking.\n\nFLORIDA WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO TEACH CIVICS AND \u2018EVILS OF COMMUNISM\u2019\n\nInterior Department officials said aside from trying to shed more light on the loss of life at the boarding schools, they will be working to protect burial sites associated with the schools and will consult with tribes on how best to do that while respecting families and communities.\n\nAs part of the initiative, a final report from agency staff is due by April 1, 2022.\n\nChuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, which had about 80 boarding schools, called the announcement encouraging and said anything that can be done to address those \"troubling chapters of history\" is a positive thing.\n\n\"I hope we don\u2019t discover gruesome incidents like were discovered in Canada. I just think it\u2019s good in this country to have conversations about what happened to Native American children,\" Hoskin said.\n\nJOSH HAWLEY BLASTS CRITICAL RACE THEORY AS BIDEN ADMIN'S \u2018ANIMATING IDEOLOGY\u2019 AS HE OPPOSES OPM NOMINEE\n\nNavajo Nation President Nez also offered his support for the initiative, noting discrimination against Native Americans continues today on many fronts \u2014 from voter suppression to high numbers of missing and murdered people.\n\n\"Last week, Congress and President Biden established \u2018Juneteenth\u2019 as a national holiday, in observance of the end of slavery, which I fully support as a means to healing the African American community,\" Nez said. \"Now, from my perspective as a Navajo person, there are so many atrocities and injustices that have been inflicted upon Native Americans dating back hundreds of years to the present day that also require national attention, so that the American society in general is more knowledgeable and capable of understanding the challenges that we face today.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the federal government has attempted to acknowledge what Haaland referred to as a \"dark history.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore than two decades ago, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Kevin Gover issued an apology for the emotional, psychological, physical and spiritual violence committed against children at the off-reservation schools. Then in 2009, President Barack Obama quietly signed off on an apology of sorts that was buried deep in a multibillion-dollar defense spending bill; the language had been watered down from the original legislation introduced years earlier.",

            "content": "RENO, Nev. \u2013 The Stewart Indian School in Carson City may come under federal review following U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's announcement that the government will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nLast month, Haaland, who is a member of New Mexico\u2019s Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, outlined the national initiative while addressing members of the National Congress of American Indians during its midyear conference.\n\nThe initiative stemmed from the discovery of a mass grave containing the remains of 215 children, all uncovered on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school. The Kamloops Indian Residential School is one of many institutions that held Indigenous children taken from families across the nation and in the United States.\n\nThe Nevada school housed thousands of students during its 90 years of operations, and local tribe members recall family members who repeatedly ran away from the school after being forcibly cut off from their families, culture and languages.\n\nThe Nevada Indian Commission has been collecting information on the history of the former Stewart Indian School, said the commission's executive director, Stacey Montooth.\n\nMontooth said the Nevada Indian Commission has not yet received direction from the U.S. Department of Interior. Still, the state agency is \u201ccommitted to following the lead of our alumni and our tribal leaders on how they want to pursue outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nMass grave of 215 children in Canada:A stark reminder of the dark history of Native American boarding schools in US\n\nMarieval Indian Residential School:Groups report discovery of 751 bodies at Indigenous school in Saskatchewan\n\n\u201cThe news that has grabbed the world\u2019s attention about the findings in Canada at their residential school, it\u2019s not surprising to Native American people,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cBut the lack of surprise doesn\u2019t make this any easier to deal with.\u201d\n\nHaaland previously said the investigation will help \u201cuncover the truth about the loss of human life and lasting consequences of the institutions.\"\n\nThe unprecedented initiative will include compiling and reviewing decades of records to locate past boarding schools, unearth known and possible burial sites at or near those schools, and identify the students\u2019 names and tribal affiliations.\n\nEarlier this week, Montooth spoke with other tribal leaders from other parts of the country who have been working to identify missing students from boarding schools.\n\nThe discovery in Canada prompted a national discussion about atrocities against Native American communities in the U.S., Montooth said.\n\nA look back at the Stewart Indian School\n\nThe Stewart Indian School opened Dec. 17, 1890, shortly after the first Indian boarding school in the country was established in Pennsylvania. It initially had three teachers and 37 students from the local Washoe, Paiute and Shoshone tribes. The school sat 3 miles southeast of Carson City and encompassed 240 acres.\n\nMontooth said the U.S. waged wars against Native American communities following a failed treaty period.\n\n\u201cThey basically tried to kill all of the Indians, and that didn\u2019t work,\" she said\n\nThe next approach involved assimilation. Montooth said the school, which stayed open for 90 years, was operated like a military academy, with the goal of assimilation.\n\nThe campus opened with a capacity for 100 students. It included a Victorian-style wood-framed dormitory and schoolhouse. As enrollment increased, new buildings were added to including a place for training, a recreation room and a hospital.\n\nAccording to the cultural center\u2019s website, a railroad stop was established in 1906 to deliver supplies and transport students to and from the school. By 1919, 400 students attended the school. Vocational training remained the school\u2019s focus until it shifted to academics in the late 1960s.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, we would call that kidnapping,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cFederal representatives of the government would physically, harshly take children and rip them from their mothers\u2019 arms and bring them to boarding schools where they were beaten for speaking their language.\"\n\nShe recalled hearing a story from a local elder who described several attempts at escaping Stewart Indian School.\n\nThe woman told Montooth the school matrons cut her hair every time they brought her back to the school.\n\n\u201cHair to Native people is just absolutely sacred,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cShe said she looked like a boy because it kept getting chopped and chopped.\u201d\n\nBudget cuts and earthquake safety issues eventually forced the school\u2019s closure in 1980.\n\nThe state acquired the campus in the '90s, and it is now being used by the state for classes, training and agency offices.\n\nThe Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California founded the Stewart community on much of the former school\u2019s land, according to the cultural center\u2019s website.\n\nMeanwhile, the school has since been listed on the National Registrar of Historic Places. The cultural center and museum is in the former administration building.",

            "content": "Elisa Lonc\u00f3n, a Chilean linguist, grew up in a \"ruka,\" a traditional wood and straw hut where the Indigenous Mapuche people live in rural areas of south-central Chile. She went to school in the nearest city, where she was the only Indigenous child in her class and had to endure daily discrimination. But giving up the opportunity for education was not an option: her mother dropped out of school in the third grade, tired of walking long hours barefoot to reach her classroom, while her father didn't learn to read until he was 17. They wanted better for her.\n\nToday, Lonc\u00f3n, 58, has a master's degree and two PhDs. She is also one of the 155 members of the country\u00b4s new constituent assembly charged with drafting the new bill of rights.\n\nAfter more than a year of social turmoil and popular discontent, Chile is entering a new stage. In October 2019, a metro fare increase sparked massive protests and riots along the country, forcing conservative President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era to agree to a referendum on rewriting the constitution inherited from General Augusto Pinochet\u00b4s bloody dictatorship. As a result, last October, over 78% of Chilean voters approved the constitutional change and last month, they cast their ballots again to pick the members for a constituent assembly.\n\nThis Sunday, this assembly has its first official session, kicking off a process that should last up to a year and produce a text that will be ratified through a new plebiscite. This is historic not only because it symbolically puts an end to the legacy of Chile's authoritarian regime. It is also a rare opportunity for any country to establish new guidelines for the 21st century.\n\nChile's constitutional assembly is expected to try to limit the privileges of an elite with a dominant hold on political power, that still acts as an oligarchy. At the center of the constitutional debate will be whether to eliminate an existing section that regulates the power of the State to develop entrepreneurial activities -- which most Chileans believe would lead to new social welfare policies. Most assembly members also aim to promote higher civic participation and better protection of the environment in the new constitution.\n\nSince it was elected, Chile\u00b4s constitutional assembly has drawn attention across Latin America both for its political, racial, and cultural diversity -- and for the uncertainty surrounding it. Conservatives worry it won't be able to generate a balanced bill of rights in a country where the voice of those who had felt marginalized has grown louder.\n\nThe composition of the assembly is undoubtedly a game-changer for politics in Chile, with 155 members who on balance reflects Chileans\u00b4 strong rejection of the established political class: The center-left and right-wing coalitions that have shared power since the return to democracy in 1990 both took a serious blow, obtaining only 16% and 24% of the seats respectively. Independents and newcomers from left-wing political parties and social movements in contrast have had their hour of glory, gathering 60% of the votes.\n\n\"There is a lot of uncertainty around the process because you have a group of people who are not professional politicians, are somewhat unexperienced and unpredictable. It's hard to know to what extent they\u00b4re willing to compromise\", says Oliver Stuenkel, Professor of International Relations at Funda\u00e7ao Getulio Vargas (FVG) in Sao Paulo and a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"But I couldn't think of a more democratic and inclusive way of doing it,\" he adds.\n\nLonc\u00f3n is a good example of this assembly\u00b4s diversity. She is both a woman and Indigenous: two groups that have found new influence in the constitutional process. Chile\u00b4s convention is the first in the world to have gender parity (77 members are women) and the first in the country\u00b4s history to include designated seats (17) for Indigenous representatives.\n\nIt also includes environmentalists, feminists, members of the LGBTQ+ community and Chileans from across the social spectrum. Lawyers, political scientists, engineers, and historians will coexist with social activists, stay-at-home mothers, and school bus drivers, among others. The average age of the constituents is 44. Many of them took part in the October 2019 protests.\n\nChile's current constitution was written under the influence of University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman\u00b4s neoliberal model. Despite its many amendments, a majority of Chileans consider it to be too free-market and blame it for the country\u00b4s stark inequalities.\n\nChile is opening up to new political actors. We were called to write something different,\" says Lonc\u00f3n.\n\nTom\u00e1s Laibe is a 30-year-old political scientist and LGBTQ+ activist who was elected to the assembly in the southern city of Puerto Ays\u00e9n. He is a member of the Socialist Party who believes his generation is transforming the way politics is done. The dominating elite used to making top-down decisions and protecting its own economic interests, is being quashed, he says.\n\n\"This is the first time that institutional politics resembles the real Chile. We won\u00b4t have men talking about women\u00b4s issues, straight people discussing sexual diversity or white people talking about the needs of Indigenous communities. We will do it ourselves because we are better represented today\", he adds.\n\nThe political disillusionment is real. According to the \"Encuesta Bicentenario\", in 2020 only 10% of Chileans trusted the government and the figure plummets to 1% when it comes to the House of Parliament.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty around the outcome of this process.\n\nThe assembly is notedly left-leaning and, so far, members on the other side of the political spectrum have been absent in the debate. CNN contacted five constituents of the right-wing coalition, but all declined to comment. Until the October referendum, most of the coalition had campaigned against changing the constitution.\n\n\"The different groups are not cohesive and even when the members of more established political parties try to reach agreements within their cohort, dissident voices rise\", says Patricio Fern\u00e1ndez, a journalist and writer from the center-left, who was elected as an independent in one of Santiago\u00b4s districts.\n\nIn the past month, constituents have virtually met to get to know each other. Even at this early stage, tensions emerged when 34 members decided to rally as a group called \"Vocer\u00eda de los Pueblos\" (Voice of the People) stating that they refused to abide by the rules for the convention, that parties from both sides of the political spectrum had agreed on before the referendum.\n\nVocer\u00eda de los Pueblos called for \"popular sovereignty\" and demanded the release of political prisoners, among other things, prompting much criticism. Yet since then, its numbers have only grown, with 11 more constituents joining.\n\n\"This whole process is full of nuances,\" says Fern\u00e1ndez. \"I didn\u00b4t like the sectarian tone of the Vocer\u00eda de los Pueblos\u00b4 statement, because we need to build a constitution upon dialogue not imposition, but when you talk to them individually, they are far less radical than it appears.\"\n\nElisa Giustinianovich, a 36-year-old chemical engineer who defines herself as an ecofeminist activist, is a member of \"Vocer\u00eda de los Pueblos.\" She lives in the southernmost region of Chile and was very active during the 2019 protests. She insists that the statement wasn\u00b4t an ultimatum and regrets the \"overreaction\" it provoked in the media, and among right and center-left politicians.\n\n\"They called us everything: fractious, antidemocratic, coup plotters. It was brutal,\" she says.\n\nThe next few weeks will be crucial to see whether the assembly members are truly open to dialogue. Conservatives fear the constitutional process will degenerate into a populist path for one leader to consolidate executive power, as has occurred in Bolivia and Venezuela. But experts say that's unlikely; Claudia Heiss, a political science PhD and author of the book \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 necesitamos una nueva constituci\u00f3n?\" (Why do we need a new constitution?), doesn\u00b4t consider it a possibility.\n\n\"In Chile we\u00b4re seeing an institutional response to a social uprising and its demands. It\u00b4s unprecedented in Latin America to have a process that starts as a revolution and turns into a convention with limited duties\", she says.\n\nNumbers alone could force the different political sectors to find consensus, as none possess the two-thirds majority required to approve a bill nor the one-third to veto. Plus there is common ground to work on: Most constituents have shown they are willing to move away from free market-oriented public policies in areas such as health, education, and pensions.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, if the convention succeeds in writing a constitution that satisfies the needs of modern Chileans, it could have a big impact on the rest of Latin America.\n\n\"The region is rudderless right now. There is this never-ending cycle of instability, popular discontent, protests and the emergence of new leaders who propose change then disappoint,\" says Stuenkel.\n\n\"If Chile does well, it has the potential of becoming a country that sets an example for others to follow.\"",

            "description": "American Medical Association criticizes 'equality as a process' and 'myth of meritocracy' in new equity plan  Fox News",
            "content": "The American Medical Association's (AMA) new equity plan commits to utilizing critical race theory (CRT) in a variety of ways and criticizes the idea that people of different backgrounds should be treated the same.\n\nReleased earlier this week, the plan is designed to \"Embed Racial Justice and Advance Health Equity\" in the organization, which is the nation's largest professional association of physicians.\n\nMuch of the 86-page document includes buzzwords typically found in other organization's \"equity\" plans but is unique in explicitly acknowledging its use of CRT. For example, AMA says its research methods will be \"informed by social epidemiology and critical race theory, recognizing the deep-rooted structural and social drivers of health.\"\n\nIn another section on \"center[ing]\" historically marginalized voices, it reads: \"We must adopt collaborative and participatory approaches and ensure that we use the theories (intersectionality, critical race theory, etc.), tools and approaches that allow us to consistently identify, elevate and work with marginalized groups in any spaces.\"\n\nAnd while CRT is often hard to define, AMA attempts to do so in its plan. \"Critical race theory born out of both legal studies and education scholarship is a framework that centers experiential knowledge, challenges dominant ideology, and mobilizes interdisciplinary action and research in order to uncover inequalities related to race and racism and other intersectional identities and/or experiences,\" the group says.\n\nCritics of CRT have argued that its injecting divisive, dangerous and often racist concepts into various institutions across the United States.\n\nMoreover, the AMA commits to \"[e]xpand medical school and physician education to include equity, anti-racism, structural competency, public health and social sciences, critical race theory and historical basis of disease\"\n\nThe document follows other programs, including a \"land acknowledgement\" for indigenous people. It criticizes the concept of treating everyone equally and, like previously reported materials, it disparages the idea of meritocracy.\n\nAlthough it states \"we are all born equal,\" it adds: \"Equality as a process means providing the same amounts and types of resources across populations. Seeking to treat everyone the \u2018same\u2019 ignores the historical legacy of disinvestment and deprivation through historical policy and practice of marginalizing and minoritizing communities. It has generated unequal society that traces back prior to the founding of our country.\"\n\nVERMONT GOVERNOR OPENS UP COVID VACCINES FOR THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS BLACK, INDIGENOUS, OR PERSON OF COLOR\n\nIt adds: \"Through systematic oppression and deprivation from genocide, forced removal from land and slavery, Indigenous and Black people have been relegated to the lowest socioeconomic ranks of this country. The ongoing xenophobic treatment of undocumented Brown people and immigrants is another example.\n\n\"Thus, intergenerational wealth has mainly benefited and exists for white families. The \u2018equality\u2019 framework, as applied, also fails individual patients and communities. For example, high-quality and safe care for a person with a disability does not translate to 'equal' care. A person with low vision receiving the \u2018same\u2019 care might receive documents that are illegible, depriving them of the ability to safely consent to and participate in their own treatment. Equality fails when applied to other domains, including language, health literacy and transgender health.\"\n\nThe document comes as so-called \"anti-racism\" has made its way into public health advocacy. Fox News previously reported on New York City's chief medical officer calling for racial preferences for Black and \"Latinx\" patients in order to address structural inequities.\n\nDrs. Michelle Morse and Bram Wispelwey, who work at a teaching hospital for Harvard University, penned an op-ed suggesting that colorblind practices were ineffective. It also called for preferential admissions for Black and \"Latinx\" heart failure patients.\n\n\"After more than five decades of colorblind law ... the stubborn persistence of racial inequities \u2013 both in health care and across society at large \u2013 gives the lie to the effectiveness of colorblind policies,\" the doctors wrote.\n\nVIRGINIA DOE PUSHES DOCUMENT ON \u2018MATHEMATICS THROUGH THE LENS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE\u2019\n\nThe state of Vermont has also come under fire for granting vaccine eligibility to certain groups while excluding people who identify as White.\n\nIt's unclear how exactly AMA's specific proposal will play out, but it touts its vision as a way to enhance the lives of individuals in various communities.\n\n\"We envision a nation in which all people live in thriving communities where resources work well; systems are equitable and create no harm nor exacerbate existing harms; where everyone has the power, conditions, resources and opportunities to achieve optimal health; and all physicians are equipped with the consciousness, tools and resources to confront inequities and dismantle white supremacy, racism, and other forms of exclusion and structured oppression, as well as embed racial justice and advance equity within and across all aspects of health systems,\" the document states.\n\nChris Rufo, who has helped lead opposition to CRT, told Fox News that the AMA is playing with fire.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Critical race theory is a destructive ideology that has no place in medicine. Critical race theorists argue explicitly that society should discriminate on the basis of race,\" he said.\n\n\"In the past year, we have seen medical treatment denied to members of particular racial groups, which is a flagrant violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The AMA is playing with fire: if they adopt critical race theory as a guiding framework, they will elevate the principles of neoracism into medical policy.\"\n\nThe AMA did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe country plans to open to vaccinated travelers from the United States in August. For those not yet ready to cross an ocean, America\u2019s northern neighbor offers a taste of many cultures.\n\nBeginning Aug. 9, Canada plans to reopen its border to nonessential American visitors \u2014 including tourists \u2014 as long as they are fully vaccinated. The decision comes after months of public pressure, largely from states and communities that share the 5,500-mile border and experienced more than a year of family separation, lost work and social upheaval. In recent weeks, Canada\u2019s vaccination rate has surged \u2014 Oxford University\u2019s Our World in Data site shows Canada leading the world in vaccinations \u2014 with 70 percent of residents at least partially vaccinated, approaching Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s vaccine targets for reopening. Americans traveling to Canada must be fully vaccinated with one of the vaccines approved in Canada \u2014 including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 and submit proof via the government\u2019s ArriveCAN app or website. They must also provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of arrival in Canada. With the relaxed restrictions, tourism officials are banking on an influx of visitors, not just to see family and friends, but to travel in a vast country rich with cultural influences from around the world. From the 17th-century French founding of Qu\u00e9bec City to the immigrant waves from China to the Vancouver area, many parts of Canada bear the influence of other places. For those Americans who aren\u2019t yet ready to cross an ocean as the world continues to reckon with Covid-19, Canada offers the world without requiring you leave North America, all at a favorable exchange rate \u2014 one U.S. dollar is currently about 1.28 Canadian dollars.\n\n\u201cThere are so many parts of Canada that feel like you\u2019ve traveled halfway around the world and are in a foreign destination,\u201d said Laurie Keith, a travel adviser and the owner of Boutique Travel Services, based in Hamilton, Ontario, who called out the wineries of the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario as resembling European vineyards, and the Northwest Territories for suggesting Iceland. Canada, of course, was formed on Indigenous land, and the recent discovery of the remains of hundreds of Indigenous children outside of boarding schools designed to assimilate them attests to the violence of that history. For those who want to get a taste of the country\u2019s oldest cultures, there are a number of ways to explore Indigenous tourism, and suggestions are included in some of the following destinations. Bear in mind that Covid rules, restrictions and business reopening dates may vary by province, territory or city and that many restaurants and attractions require advance reservations.\n\n\u201cI often call Qu\u00e9bec City \u2018Paris without the jet lag,\u2019\u201d Robert Mercure, the general manager of Qu\u00e9bec City Tourism, said. There\u2019s no Eiffel Tower, of course, but there\u2019s enough 17th-century ambience to make a convincing case for provenance, particularly in central Old Qu\u00e9bec, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the only walled city in North America outside of Mexico. Here, you\u2019ll find the grand Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral-Basilica; the Qu\u00e9bec Ursulines Convent, the continent\u2019s oldest school for girls (museum admission, 12 Canadian dollars, or about $9.50); and nearly three miles of walls encircling the city that visitors can walk upon. Outdoor living is a hallmark of life in Qu\u00e9bec (even in winter, when the city holds its popular Winter Carnival). In summer, many of Old Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s lanes are closed to cars, allowing pedestrian-only access to shop-lined Rue Saint-Jean and the cafes of cobblestoned Rue du Petit-Champlain. \u201cQu\u00e9bec City is probably the most European city in all of North America,\u201d said Allison Van Rassel, a local resident and food columnist for Radio-Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). \u201cIt\u2019s really centered around that very heavy heritage of French culture, but it\u2019s Nouvelle France, with a North American influence and modern approach,\u201d including sourcing local products, she added. Meals run the gamut \u2014 from a jambon beurre or ham sandwich (8.95 dollars) at the bakery cafe Paillard to multicourse tasting menus that may include foraged ingredients in a stone cellar at Tani\u00e8re3 (from 150 dollars). Sleeping in the heritage section of town usually comes at a premium, but Manoir Sur-le-Cap near the landmark luxury hotel Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac has 14 reasonable rooms, some with stone walls (from 149 dollars, May through October).\n\n\u201cI walk out the same doors they did,\u201d said Jeff Douglas, the lead guide at Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise resort, where adventures like hiking and canoeing in summer, and skiing and snowshoeing in winter have supplanted Alpine summiting. \u201cBanff National Park offers sights you wouldn\u2019t otherwise experience in France, Italy or Switzerland, like our local grizzly bear populations,\u201d said Kim Gray, a Calgary-based writer and publisher of the Canadian travel blog Toque & Canoe. She recommends taking a medicine walk in the park with an Indigenous guide through Mahikan Trails (65 dollars), and a scenic ride to about 7,500 feet aboard the Banff Gondola (55 dollars). One of the original railway hotels in the town of Banff, the Fairmont Banff Springs, with peaked roofs, dormers and lavish interiors, is reminiscent of the grand hotels of Europe (the fondue at its Bavarian cottage restaurant Waldhaus Pub & Biergarten, 89 dollars, is worth the splurge). Save by renting a cabin with its own kitchen and wood-burning stove at Castle Mountain Chalets (from 210 dollars) at the foot of Castle Mountain between Banff and Lake Louise. During the pandemic, a two-block stretch of main street in downtown Banff has been turned into a pedestrian zone with outdoor dining tables for savoring mountain views over meals (there\u2019s even valet parking for bikes). Nearby, the new Three Bears Brewery and Restaurant has a retractable roof for stargazing.\n\nInstead of China, try the Vancouver area When Judy Lam Maxwell, the owner of Historical Chinatown Tours, guides her three-hour food and walking tours of Chinatown in Vancouver (100 dollars), she introduces travelers to the private heritage buildings in the district that once served Chinese immigrants, who came in the late 1800s to build Canada\u2019s transcontinental railroad. They housed associations that provided accommodation, banking, social events and protection against discrimination. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to go in and see the elders playing mahjong and the insides of these buildings, which are like museums,\u201d said Ms. Lam Maxwell, who continues the tour with a two-hour lesson in dumpling making, which she describes as central to Chinese culture: \u201cIt\u2019s bonding and sharing food.\u201d A wave of immigration preceded the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule; another more recent wave has been linked to China\u2019s booming economy. Many newcomers settled in the suburb of Richmond, which is 54 percent ethnic Chinese, according to a 2016 census, and home to Asian shopping malls, the International Buddhist Temple and, most famously, food, including more than 800 restaurants, a \u201cdumpling trail\u201d of more than 20 restaurants, including Empire Seafood, and a night market reopening July 23. \u201cIn North America, Chinese food is pasteurized in so many ways,\u201d said Alex Chen, who emigrated to the area from Malaysia as a teenager and is the executive chef at Vancouver\u2019s Boulevard Kitchen & Oyster Bar, where the cooking is grounded in French techniques. Around Vancouver, the Chinese options are regional, he added, or specialize in hot pot dishes, noodles, fried rice and more. Among his Richmond favorites are HK BBQ Master for Peking duck and Chef Tony Seafood Restaurant for innovative dim sum. \u201cWe are so blessed and lucky to have lots of choices at the very highest standards,\u201d he said. Back around Vancouver\u2019s original Chinatown, stay at Skwach\u00e0ys Lodge, a boutique hotel devoted to Indigenous art and culture (from 170 dollars), just a few blocks from the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden.\n\nInstead of Stratford, England, try Stratford, Ontario For theater lovers, going to Stratford-upon-Avon in England, home of William Shakespeare and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is going to the source for classic theater. For Shakespeare lovers on this side of the Atlantic, Stratford, Ontario, is a similar mecca. Since 1953, the Stratford Festival has been performing a robust repertoire of Shakespearean classics \u2014 with actors from Alec Guinness and Maggie Smith to Colm Feore and Chilina Kennedy \u2014 as well as large-scale musicals and intimate cabarets. After a pandemic pause in 2020, the 2021 festival is back through Oct. 5, albeit smaller \u2014 six plays and five cabarets \u2014 and with most performances outside and not in repertory to protect the actors from mingling. (A maximum of eight performers per show makes for some interesting double casting.) Stratford\u2019s evolution as an English doppelg\u00e4nger was serendipitous, according to John Kastner, the general manager of the history-focused Stratford Perth Museum. When the town\u2019s economic reliance on railway maintenance cratered around 1950, Tom Patterson, a local community booster inspired by the city\u2019s English namesake, proposed the town found a performing arts festival, which soon flourished. Before the pandemic, the Stratford Festival typically drew 500,000 attendees during its usual April-to-October run.\n\nSo much in the culture revolves around music, as explored at the Celtic Music Interpretive Center in coastal Judique, which offers exhibitions and lunchtime c\u00e8ilidhs in its restaurant. In nearby Mabou, the Red Shoe Pub, owned by the musical Rankin Family, serves food and programs music daily. \u201cGaelic probably survived as long as it did because of song,\u201d said Heather Rankin, a vocalist and co-owner of the pub, adding that c\u00e8ilidhs and dances can be found around Cape Breton any night of the week in summer. \u201cThe cover is usually 10 or six dollars. It\u2019s affordable world-class music.\u201d Nearby, travelers can check into a room at the Glenora Inn & Distillery (from 159 dollars), maker of Scottish-style single malt whisky.

            "content": "Words I never thought I\u2019d write. A lifelong Big Apple advocate who\u2019s shared my optimism in these pages through our worst days \u2014 after 9/11 and throughout the pandemic \u2014 I now see little to no hope of rescuing our socio-political culture from its decline into nihilistic lunacy.\n\nThis week, New York City public schools abolished Columbus Day for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day \u2014 a move that offends me less as an Italian American than as an American.\n\nBanning Columbus is not about addressing the explorer\u2019s wrongs, which have been no secret to any educated person for at least 50 years. It\u2019s undeniable that his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of America led to cruel subjugation of Native Americans. But it also opened the door to a New World that people around the globe came to envy for its humanistic culture, material abundance and however-imperfect embrace of individual liberty. If Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d America, canceling him is about canceling America.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Columbus committed his crimes against humanity over five centuries ago, when slaughter and slavery were the way of much of the world. And yet, our city celebrates criminals who committed their heinous deeds in much more recent memory.\n\nTake, for example, Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was invited by our City Council to lead the Puerto Rican Day Parade in 2017 \u2014 just 25 years after helming the terrorist organization FALN, which launched more than 100 bombings on US soil.\n\nOr early 20th century black separatist Marcus Garvey, who wanted to repatriate black Americans to Liberia. He consorted with the Ku Klux Klan on how to achieve it. He was so nuts that fellow radical W.E.B. Du Bois condemned him as \u201cthe most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and in the world.\u201d Garvey blamed \u201cdirty Jews\u201d for a fraud conviction that sent him to prison \u2014 a crime for which former President Barack Obama declined to pardon him.\n\nBut in our looney-tunes town, Garvey could do no wrong. Thanks to city bureaucrats, his name adorns a Harlem park and a Brooklyn housing project.\n\nFact: Many of our city\u2019s leaders really, truly, do not like this country at all \u2014 from its \u201cinequity\u201d to its health care to its fast food. And they\u2019ve seized control of the microphone like Third World guerrillas who breach the palace defenses.\n\nOur bureaucrat class seethes with thinly concealed, sneering contempt for citizens of European \u2014 and Asian \u2014 descent. Which is why the imbeciles at the Department of Education nixed Columbus Day on the new school calendar and replaced it with Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day \u2014 even though the city is still home to at least 800,000 Italian Americans, its largest ethnic group according to the US census.\n\nIn our corridors of learning, the howling minority rules.\n\nNot even Italian-American Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Italian-American Mayor Bill de Blasio, who are supposed to be in charge of city public schools, could save poor Columbus from cancellation.\n\nDe Blasio later criticized the move as \u201carbitrary\u201d and claimed that neither he nor schools chancellor Meisha Ross Porter was consulted on it.\n\nCuomo, too, threw up his hands: They didn\u2019t tell me! Neither did anyone else know, certainly not teachers who\u2019ve been effectively on strike during the COVID-19 pandemic while collecting full pay for fourteen months.\n\nBack in 2017, I wrote that the true goal of a campaign to remove Columbus monuments and other tainted national heroes was to repudiate \u201cthe legitimacy of the United States of America itself.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s economy will survive the pandemic. Real estate and Broadway will rebound.\n\nBut right now, I can\u2019t get over the feeling that the city I love regards me, and millions of others who still believe in America, as chopped liver. New York City is so bent to the prevailing progressive winds that reversing the tide seems hopeless.",

            "content": "Aiyanna Highwolf, one of Allison Highwolf\u2019s daughters, tending to her mother\u2019s grave on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWhen a Northern Cheyenne family questioned their daughter\u2019s untimely death, official indifference deepened their pain \u2014 and their suspicions.\n\nNORTHERN CHEYENNE RESERVATION, Mont. \u2014 The knock on the door came at 3 a.m., when Pauline Highwolf opened it to see a police officer from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d she said, backing away. The body of her 26-year-old daughter, Allison Highwolf, had been found alone in a motel room in Hardin, the officer said. It was February 2015, and Ms. Highwolf, who had been living in the motel with her boyfriend, had died of smoke inhalation from a fire of unclear origin. The state medical examiner\u2019s report said the manner of her death was undetermined, but suggested suicide. Ms. Highwolf\u2019s family suspected foul play, given the strange circumstances. Ms. Highwolf had struggled with alcohol, her family members acknowledged, but she was a mother of four and they did not believe that she would take her own life. The boyfriend told police he had returned to the motel that night to find the room filled with smoke and Ms. Highwolf\u2019s body blocking the door.\n\nSix years later, the circumstances of Ms. Highwolf\u2019s death remain a mystery, one of many involving Native women who disappear or meet violent ends with alarming regularity. Her family and the local authorities agree that the case was shoddily handled and the initial investigation haphazard, as is often the case for Native Americans. \u201cThey put her in the category of \u2018just another drunken Indian,\u2019\u201d said one of Ms. Highwolf\u2019s sisters, Rhea New Holy. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t.\u201d Today, under pressure from her family and an advocacy group in California, Ms. Highwolf\u2019s case is under review. Pauline Highwolf is relieved it has been reopened, but she says a six-year effort to get there underscores the need for change in the way such cases are handled. \u201cWe want to keep fighting, until we are heard,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want everyone who lost someone to keep fighting and know they\u2019re not alone.\u201d In Montana, Native Americans, mostly young women, accounted for one-third of the 110 active missing persons cases in the missing persons\u2019 clearinghouse at the end of 2019, according to a 2020 study by the state\u2019s Justice Department. Big Horn County, where Ms. Highwolf\u2019s body was found, and neighboring Rosebud County, home of the Northern Cheyenne reservation, lead the state for the number of missing people reported per capita. Last year, in the same town where Ms. Highwolf died, the body of Kaysera Stops Pretty Places, 18, who had been missing, was found in a backyard. Her case remains open.\n\nUnderreporting and poor record-keeping obscure the dimensions of the problem, but data that does exist suggests the risk of rape or sexual assault is 2.5 times higher for Native women, and murder is their third leading cause of death, according to the Urban Indian Health Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a hesitancy within our communities to work with law enforcement because law enforcement doesn\u2019t care about us,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, a Pawnee Nation member who is chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board and directs the Urban Indian Health Institute. The Not Invisible Act and Savanna\u2019s Act, two bills signed in late 2020, proposed channeling more federal resources and attention to these cases, improving cross-jurisdictional enforcement and data collection. But putting the change into action has been slow, advocates say, despite stated support from President Biden and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen who has made missing and murdered Indigenous women a policy priority. Instead, a patchwork of committed people and groups helps families search for missing loved ones and plead for full investigations of unexplained deaths. Mary Kathryn Nagle, a lawyer who represents pro bono the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women, calls the effort \u201cthe most hopeless line of work you can do in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in a position of authority is going to help you,\u201d said Ms. Nagle, who is a Cherokee Nation citizen. \u201cI think a lot of families give up.\u201d \u201cI went on a rampage of anger,\u201d Pauline Highwolf said. \u201cI want to live to see justice for my baby.\u201d Pauline Highwolf described her daughter as her \u201cmiracle baby,\u201d born amid complications mother and daughter both survived. Growing up, Allison Highwolf had an effervescent personality, her mother said, and worked sporadically at the Boys & Girls Club in Lame Deer. Sometimes she joined her mother at powwows. \u201cShe was humble and loving,\u201d Pauline Highwolf recalled. \u201cAnd forgiving, no matter what anybody did to her. She would see people making fun of people with addictions on the street, and she would get mad and say, \u2018Don\u2019t laugh at them. Don\u2019t make fun of them. What if it\u2019s one of us?\u2019 It made us think. It made everybody think.\u201d\n\nAt the time of her death, Ms. Highwolf and her boyfriend were living at the Rodeway Inn in Hardin, in part because neither of their families approved of the relationship. The boyfriend, Stephen Auker, worked nights. Police said the fire in the motel room started sometime between his departure for work in the late afternoon and the time Ms. Highwolf was found dead, around midnight. In a phone call, Mr. Auker responded by offering to connect The Times with his attorney, but he did not provide the attorney\u2019s name or respond to subsequent efforts to reach him. The county coroner did not allow Ms. Highwolf\u2019s family to see her body, which was covered in soot. She was autopsied at the state medical examiner\u2019s office in Billings. A few days later, a mortician delivered her body, dressed in a white lace blouse, pants and moccasins her family chose for her, to the front room of Pauline Highwolf\u2019s single-story house on the Northern Cheyenne reservation, where most of her family still lives. Mourners arrived at the house for her wake. Some brought earrings for Ms. Highwolf to wear. Ms. New Holy would play Dani and Lizzy\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Sky,\u201d a song about young, untimely death that Ms. Highwolf loved. But when the family opened the coffin, they gasped in horror. Ms. Highwolf\u2019s face looked injured, with a scuff on her cheek and a bulging bruise on her forehead. The family folded down her lace collar and pulled up her sleeves. Pauline Highwolf used her cellphone to photograph marks on her daughter\u2019s face, neck, wrists and hands. Fears that she had been beaten or strangled tormented them.\n\n\u201cJust because your daughter died, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you,\u201d she said one officer told her. Efforts to pursue a wrongful-death lawsuit against the motel fizzled, Ms. New Holy said. Private investigators cost more than the family could afford. By 2019, four years after Ms. Highwolf\u2019s death, another sister, Kim Red Cherries, used Facebook to contact the Sovereign Bodies Institute, a nonprofit in California that helps Indigenous people who are the victims of sexual violence. Last month, after nearly two years of effort, Annita Lucchesi, the organization\u2019s director, who had publicly declared Ms. Highwolf\u2019s death a murder, arranged a meeting with the Montana state medical examiner and other authorities to begin a review of Ms. Highwolf\u2019s case. The nearly four-hour meeting, held late last month and described to The New York Times by participants, raised more questions. Jay Harris, the Big Horn County Attorney, reviewed copies of police reports in the meeting, including one that said the police found an entry in a journal in the motel room that could be interpreted as a suicide note. It was the first time the family had heard of such a note, and Pauline Highwolf remains skeptical of it. She has since seen a photograph of it and said she was unsure whether the handwriting was her daughter\u2019s. Pauline Highwolf also strongly objected to a statement in the post-mortem report that her daughter had \u201ca prior history of suicide attempts.\u201d That was not the case, she said. Mr. Harris said the information came from a Big Horn County law enforcement officer on the night of Allison Highwolf\u2019s death, but could not explain why the officer included it. The officer has since left the department, and did not respond to messages left on his cellphone.\n\n\u201cIn addition to working with law enforcement investigators, my office is working with representatives of the family to conduct a full prosecutorial review of all evidence available,\u201d the statement said. It concluded that \u201cthere is no statute of limitations in Montana for homicide, but time is always of the essence when the interests of justice and closure to family and loved ones is at stake.\u201d On one recent afternoon, Ms. Highwolf\u2019s four daughters clustered around their grandmother\u2019s kitchen table, making a decoration for their mother\u2019s grave: a depiction of a red dress, a symbol of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u2019s movement. Ms. Highwolf is buried in a parched hilltop cemetery where several generations of her family lie, her grave strung with lights that her family can see from their front window at night.",

            "description": "They've been beaten, trolled, threatened with sexual violence but refuse to be silenced  CNN International",
            "content": "Abuja, Nigeria -- On September 22, 2020 while out filming, Indigenous Guatemalan journalist Andrea Ixch\u00edu Hern\u00e1ndez was attacked shortly after she had reported illegal loggers operating in the Totonicap\u00e1n forest.\n\n\"One of them hit me on the head, the other one on my chest and on my knee,\" she tells CNN, recounting the incident from her home in Totonicap\u00e1n in Guatemala's western highlands.\n\n\"Luckily, as one of these attackers was trying to hit me with her machete, one of the rangers managed to push her away and that was how I escaped. Basically, he saved my life.\"\n\nIxch\u00edu Hern\u00e1ndez's ribs were broken and she was bed bound for two months. She also sustained injuries to her spine. \"I am still recovering from that. It was really awful and really violent,\" she says, her voice strained as she recounts the incident. \"As I am speaking about it, I am realising again how dangerous it was.\"\n\nThe physical attack she suffered that day may have not been premeditated but it was also not unimaginable. Ixch\u00edu Hern\u00e1ndez had already been the victim of years of online threats -- attempts to humiliate and silence her.\n\n\"I have been facing this since 2012. I have a long record of different ways and different times in Guatemala where I have faced digital threats,\" she says before explaining further: \"I faced situations where people were attacking me on Twitter and Facebook, [and sharing] misinformation [about me] on Whatsapp. Once, in my hometown, one of these men printed a meme with rumours against me and my family and propagated it in the public square and in the local market.\"\n\nThe Maltese investigative journalist had risen to international prominence for her reporting that revealed her island's elites were benefiting from offshore tax havens as part of the Panama Papers leaks.\n\nOn October 17, 2017 just half an hour after she'd published a blogpost about alleging corruption at the core of the Maltese government, the 53-year-old was killed by a car bomb in a small town called Bidnija.\n\n\"In the early years, she received threats by phone; later this became a concerted campaign of offline and online harassment. My father and my brothers and I were targeted in an attempt to silence her. Our pet dogs were killed, our home was set alight ... Unprotected by Malta's institutions, including the police force and the courts, killing her was not only desirable but it became conceivable.\"\n\nUnfortunately, both women's stories -- of online harassment that culminates in offline violence -- are not exceptional.\n\nThe report which is based on a global survey of 901 journalists in 125 countries, a further 173 interviews and two big data case studies that analyse 2.5 million Facebook and Twitter posts, concludes that \"women journalists are both the primary targets of online violence and the first responders to it.\" In addition, a journalist's race, sexual orientation and religion, exposes her to \"even more frequent and vitriolic attacks\".\n\nReferring to its respondents, compared to 64% of white women journalists, 81% of women journalists identifying as Black, 86% identifying as Indigenous, and 88% of Jewish- identifying women journalists reported experiencing online violence, which the report defines as \"misogynistic harassment, abuse and threats; digital privacy and security breaches that increase physical risks associated with online violence; and coordinated disinformation campaigns leveraging misogyny and other forms of hate speech\".\n\nThe authors add: \"A similar pattern can be seen when analysing the survey data through a sexual orientation lens: while 72% of heterosexual women indicated they had been targeted in online attacks, the rates of exposure for those identifying as lesbian and bisexual women were much higher - standing at 88% and 85% respectively.\"\n\nOn the individual level, the violence takes not just a physical toll but also a psychological and emotional one. Beyond questions of individual safety, the ICFJ and UNESCO study finds that attacks on women journalists reveal an enduring misogyny that trickles down from the most powerful in society -- political leaders -- and which threatens democracy itself.\n\nAgain from the report: \"Another major issue in evidence is the role of political actors - including presidents and elected representatives, party officials and members - in instigating and fuelling online violence campaigns against women journalists.\"\n\n\"Online violence against women journalists is designed to: belittle, humiliate, and shame; induce fear, silence, and retreat; discredit them professionally, undermining accountability journalism and trust in facts; and chill their active participation...in public debate. This amounts to an attack on democratic deliberation and media freedom... It cannot afford to be normalised or tolerated as an inevitable aspect of online discourse.\"\n\nSo, what does recourse look like? At the individual level, Sherry Ricchiardi-Folwell, who was the director of the now-ended DART Center for Journalism and Trauma Affiliate Program at Indiana University, and has worked as a media trainer from Pakistan to Ethiopia, talks about the need to create spaces for women journalists to talk about their experiences.\n\nRicchiardi-Folwell explains that because of the often-sexualised nature of the attacks, women remain silent about their harassment, which leads them to believe they are alone. Talking helps counter the sense of isolation.\n\nThen there is a role for media employers in making sure their journalists are safe on their platforms and recognising how exposure to online or offline attacks may affect a woman's confidence.\n\nFolajaiye Kareem, a clinical psychologist in Abuja, Nigeria, points out that feeling ostracised and fearful of further attacks, women journalists may avoid reporting on the very stories they deem important and be apprehensive about taking up leadership positions.\n\n\"If you look at this, it is synonymous with traumatic responses, such that they are anxious and anticipate that they will be harassed over a story. This may cause them to let go in defence of themselves,\" he says.\n\nThe ICFJ/UNESCO report presents 28 recommendations in total, including, \"make social media companies more clearly accountable for combating online violence against women journalists,\" and \"recognise and work to counter the role of officials active in facilitating and orchestrating large-scale and continuous online attacks on women journalists.\"\n\nFor Ixch\u00edu Hern\u00e1ndez, support networks have been invaluable to her recovery and resilience as she continues to report on the destruction of biodiversity in Guatemala. \"The care of my family, the support of my neighbours and the indigenous authorities of my community gives me the strength to continue,\" she says.\n\n\"But editors should understand that women make great explorers, researchers and interviewers precisely because most of those who have lots of power still tend to be male -- who better than women to understand and find out what these men are really up to?\" she asks.\n\n\"We are less likely to excuse them precisely because we are not in the traditional old boys' clubs.\"",

            "description": "Cecily Brown Enlivens A High School In Buffalo With A Mural Painted In Collaboration With Local Artists  Forbes",
            "content": "When formulating how she would approach a commission to paint a gigantic mural on the side of a building at the Buffalo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts High School, Cecily Brown faced many challenges.\n\nFirstly, the project, which was conceived in partnership with the University of Buffalo Arts Collaboratory and Bortolami gallery, involved collaboration between Brown and seven different Buffalo-based artists, all of whom had disparate styles and backgrounds. Secondly, Brown and her collaborators wanted the painting to relate the high school and the city where it was located, without knocking the viewer over the head with obvious references. And thirdly, given that the mural is permanent, the participants wanted the mural to be timeless, but also speak to the current moment, which involves a renewed fight for social justice and a recognition cultures indigenous to the Buffalo area. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to look ridiculous to future students,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut we still wanted it to have little flashes of things people today would recognize.\u201d\n\nThe process of planning the mural \u2014 which is 45 x 35 feet, and spans two-stories \u2014 began over Zoom in the spring and continued in person in June at The Space Between, an arts incubator in Buffalo. Over sketches and discussions, a composition emerged. Dance and movement, which are taught at the high school, took center stage, as did portraits of students, slogans they use, and local flora and fauna.\n\nIt was important to the artists that they pay homage to the Haudenosaunee, the confederacy of Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas who lived freely in the Northeast before the land was forcibly settled by Europeans in the 18th century. (The city now known as Buffalo sits on Seneca land.) The title of the mural, \u201cThe Flight of the Chickadee,\u201d takes its name from the Haudenosaunee creation story, which states that a chickadee bird gave its life so that human beings could flourish on the earth. \u201cThe name has the sort of sweetness and grounded-ness we were looking for,\u201d says Jodi Lynn Maracle, a Buffalo-based artist and a member of the Mohawk tribe who collaborated on the project. When the city of Buffalo was built, it erased much of the Haudenosaunee culture that existed there already, Maracle says. In the mural, plants were chosen to reflect those used by indigenous people in all four seasons.\n\nThe mural, which is dominated by a shade of shocking, happy yellow, uses much of Brown\u2019s visual language \u2014 in past work, Brown has broken down movement and form into abstract gestures. In the Buffalo mural, she was aided in this project by Julia Bottoms, a figurative painter and portraitist best known for her murals and especially the Freedom Wall, a collaborative work located at the Michigan Street African American Heritage Corridor in Buffalo. \u201cWe wanted to make sure the abstraction was still legible and meant something to the people looking at it,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIt was important to break down the figures very gradually, and Julia invented a scheme to do that.\u201d\n\nBrown painted much of the top section of the mural herself, lifted into the air by a forklift. The bottom section of the mural, which is more conventionally figurative, featuring everything from students wearing \u201cBLM\u201d sweatshirts to local fiddlehead ferns unfurling as if awoken by the yellow background, was painted by Maracle, George Hughes, Sarah Zak and Jae Skeese. Other artists who participated in the project include Nalia Ansari and Pam Glick. \u201cThe other artists were incredibly generous with their ideas,\u201d Brown says. The preparatory work done as a collective is on view at the Space Between through this upcoming Saturday, July 31.\n\nBrown, who has never worked on a collaborative public mural like this before, loved the experience. \u201cIt is very gratifying that it\u2019s not something for sale, and cannot be owned,\u201d she says. In the future, she would love to do more murals. \u201cI\u2019m a complete egomaniac, and I would love to cover every surface in sight with my daubs,\u201d she laughs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see how that could enrich any city, especially if done in similar collaboration with local artists. The mural at the Buffalo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts High School almost seems to energize the air around it. Even without students present, one looks at it, and senses that the school has a lot of life within.\n\n\u201cNone of us knew how it would work,\u201d Brown says of the collaboration. \u201cThere were so many voices, and in the end, I think we were able to include all of our ideas.\u201d",

            "content": "IKEA Canada has unveiled a series of colorful couches inspired by different Pride flags, including those representing the transgender, nonbinary and asexual communities.\n\nCreated to mark Pride Month, the 10 \"Love Seats\" were created by four LGBTQ designers and feature everything from gigantic ruffles to colorful patters and faux flowers.\n\nThe Swedish retailer said in a press release that it hopes the campaign will honor \"the richness and diversity of the 2SLGBTQ+ community,\" using an expanded acronym that encompasses those identifying as two-spirit, an Indigenous American term for those with both a male and female spirit.\n\n\"There's more to Pride than a rainbow,\" IKEA said, alluding to the range of flags featured in the campaign, including the lesbian flag and the pink, yellow and blue pansexual flag. The company described the couches as \"a platform to celebrate identity and share stories of love.\"\n\nAlthough the eye-catching designs were unveiled last week, buzz has grown online in recent days. And while the couches were broadly celebrated, some stirred debate on social media.\n\nIn particular, a purple and pink \"bisexual\" couch, designed by Charlotte Carbone, divided opinions. Drawing on the colors of the bisexual flag, the sofa is layered with hand-shaped fabric -- and features armrests resembling actual arms.\n\nMore serious concerns were leveled against a phrase featured on the cushions reading, \"When you change 'or' to 'and,' nobody believes you.\"\n\nHe added that the hands were \"meant to represent the audience reaction, especially those of other bisexual folks who would approach me after performances and share their story with me.\"\n\nAs part of the IKEA campaign, individuals from of all the communities represented sat on their respective couches as they told their personal stories to the camera.\n\nThe company has not announced plans to sell the couches, although some social media users expressed interest in buying them. For now, the couches are being displayed at select IKEA stores in Canada.",

            "description": "The Theodore Roosevelt statue in front of New York's Museum of Natural History will finally be removed  CNN International",
            "content": "The statue debuted in 1940 and stands in front of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It features the 26th president on horseback flanked by a Native American man on one side and an African man on the other -- conveying a \"racial hierarchy that the museum and members of the public have long found disturbing,\" wrote the museum in its initial removal request last June.\n\nOn Monday, the New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously to remove the statue, marking the final step after a year of discussion.\n\nSam Biederman, chief of staff and assistant commissioner at NYC Parks, called the move to remove the statue \"incredibly rare,\" but \"the right course of action.\"\n\n\"Though historical circumstances demonstrate that this sculpture was not erected with malice of intent, the compositional hierarchy ... visually supports the thematic framework of colonization and racism,\" he said during Monday's meeting.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio supported the removal effort last year, calling it \"the right decision and the right time\" in a statement to CNN. \"The American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior,\" his office said at the time. Though the statue's new home has not yet been determined, the city and museum will coordinate a long-term loan of the statue to publicly accessible grounds or a cultural institution dedicated to Roosevelt, officials with NYC's Public Design Commission said. The move by the city and the museum comes as statues, commonly odes to the Confederacy, are being taken down across the US. Earlier this year, statues of two Confederate generals were removed in Georgia . In December, Virginia removed a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee from the US Capitol, with plans to replace it with a statue of Barbara Rose Johns , a Black woman who played a key role in the Civil Rights Movement.",

            "content": "(CNN) The gruesome discovery took decades and for some survivors of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Canada, the confirmation that children as young as 3 were buried on school grounds crystallizes the sorrow they have carried all their lives.\n\n\"I lost my heart, it was so much hurt and pain to finally hear, for the outside world, to finally hear what we assumed was happening there,\" said Harvey McLeod, who attended the school for two years in the late 1960s, in a telephone interview with CNN Friday.\n\n\"The story is so unreal, that yesterday it became real for a lot of us in this community,\" he said.\n\nThe Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc community in the southern interior of British Columbia, where the school was located, released a statement late Thursday saying an \"unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented\" was confirmed.\n\n\"This past weekend, with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist, the stark truth of the preliminary findings came to light -- the confirmation of the remains of 215 children who were students of the Kamloops Indian Residential School,\" said Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc community.\n\n\"To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,\" she said in the statement.\n\n\"Sometimes people didn't come back, we were happy for them, we thought they ran away, not knowing if they did or whatever happened to them,\" said McLeod, who now serves as chief of British Columbia's Upper Nicola band.\n\n\"There were discussions that this may have happened, that they may have passed,\" he says adding, \"What I realized yesterday was how strong I was, as a little boy, how strong I was to be here today, because I know that a lot of people didn't go home.\"\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential school was one of the largest in Canada and operated from the late 19th century to the late 1970s. It was opened and run by the Catholic Church until the federal government took it over in the late 1960s.\n\nIt closed permanently about a decade later and now houses a museum and a community facility with both cultural and memorial events.\n\n\"We recognize the tragic, heartbreaking devastation that the Canadian residential school system has inflicted upon so many, and our thoughts are with all of those who are in mourning today,\" she said.\n\nThe report detailed decades of physical, sexual and emotional abuse suffered by children in government and church run institutions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Carolyn Bennett, Canada's minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, says this revelation speaks to all Canadians about a \"very painful truth\" and a \"horrific chapter in Canadian history.\"\n\n\"This was the reason why five of the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission wanted us to deal with the missing children and the unmarked graves because they knew there was much more than what they had been able to ascertain at the hearings,\" said Bennett.\n\nIn 2019, Trudeau said he and his government accepted the harm inflicted on indigenous peoples in Canada amounted to genocide, saying at the time that the government would move forward to \"end this ongoing tragedy.\"\n\nMcLeod says the residential school system scarred generations in his family and the abuse he suffered at the school in Kamloops terrorized him, his family and his classmates.\n\n\"The abuse that happened to me was physical, yes, was sexual, yes, and in 1966 I was a person that didn't want to live anymore, it changed me,\" said McLeod, comparing the trauma he suffered to that of a prisoner of war.\n\nHe says he entered the school in 1966 along with most of his siblings.\n\n\"Seven of us went at the same time, same school that my mum and my dad went to, there wasn't an option, it was a requirement, it was the law. And I can only imagine what my mom and my dad, how they felt, when they dropped some of us there knowing what they experienced at that school,\" he said.\n\nAs was documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, many of the children in residential schools did not receive adequate medical care with some dying prematurely of diseases like tuberculous.\n\nThe commission estimates that more than 4,000 children died while at residential schools over a period of several decades, but the final commission report acknowledges it was impossible to know the true number.\n\nMcLeod says this week's discovery at his former school has already helped community members he knows discuss the abuse they suffered and the inter-generational trauma it has caused.\n\nHe says he would like to be engaged in healing and now wants to avoid pointing fingers or blame.\n\n\"I have forgiven, I have forgiven my parents, I have forgiven my abusers, I have broken the chain that held me back at that school, I don't want to live there anymore but at the same time make sure that the people who didn't come home are acknowledged and respected and brought home in a good way,\" he said.",

            "content": "A staffer for Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland was caught on camera awkwardly crawling on the floor behind her during an interview on \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d \u2014 and quickly became the butt of a joke.\n\nHaaland, 60, was speaking about being the first Native American woman to hold the position when the funnyman host spotted a guy in a suit on all fours.\n\n\u201cConsidering I was sworn in by the very first female vice president, also a woman of color, that was really probably the best par \u2014\u201d Haaland said before Meyers cut her off.\n\n\u201cI am sorry, Secretary. I am going to interrupt you real quick,\u201d Meyers said as the staffer sneakily ducked behind a desk and out of the frame.\n\n\u201cYou have a staffer who fully crawled on the carpet behind you \u2014 and it is the greatest thing I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nMeyers added with a grin, \u201cSir, we know you\u2019re behind the desk.\u201d\n\nThe man, who was carrying camera equipment, then shuffled on his knees out of the frame during the live segment.\n\n\u201cNow, Secretary, be honest,\u201d Meyers quipped. \u201cDo you know who that man is and are those someone else\u2019s glasses he\u2019s wearing?\u201d\n\nHaaland laughed and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have people sort of sneaking around, so, yes, I know who that is.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThank you for making light of it, Seth.\u201d\n\nBut Meyers said he should be thanking her because the staffer \u2014 who was later revealed to be Haaland\u2019s photographer \u2014 had provided the show with potentially viral comedy gold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had giant comedy stars on this show and not one of them has thought to have somebody crawl by in the background,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two then finished their conversation about Haaland\u2019s role as it relates to land and the importance of having Indigenous representation in the cabinet. Haaland was confirmed as the 54th United States secretary of the interior in 51-40 vote in March.\n\nMeyers later tweeted, \u201cI so enjoyed having @SecDebHaaland on the show but not as much as having her photographer Tami try to sneak through the background. Thank you, both!!!! Sneakery begins at 1:20.\u201d\n\nReplying to the tweet, one observer wondered, \u201cDid he ever become a meme?\u201d",

Especially in 2021!!!! it has always been #freepalestine. ALWAYS. I have a lot to say about this but for now, please read and educate yourself. This is not about religion. This is not about spewing hate on one or the other. This is about Israeli colonization, ethnic cleansing, military occupation and apartheid over the Palestinian people that has been going on for YEARS,\" she wrote in the deleted post.\n\nGAL GADOT SLAMMED AFTER CALLING FOR UNITY FOR ISRAEL AND 'NEIGHBORS' IN GAZA AMID ONGOING CONFLICT\n\nMany Instagram users pointed out the various inaccuracies in Hadid's post, including perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nA rep for Hadid did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.\n\nIsraeli actress-turned-author Noa Tishby, who recently penned the book \"Israel: A Simple Guide to the Most Misunderstood Country on Earth,\" told Fox News Hadid is contributing to \"flaming anti-Semitism like we've never seen.\"\n\nTishby said it's incredibly dangerous when people like Hadid \u2013 who has 41.7 Instagram followers compared to the 14 million Jews in the world \u2013 \"recite Hamas talking points.\"\n\n\"People don't understand that Jews are indigenous to the land of Israel. Israel is not a colonialist state,\" Tishby told us. \"Hamas is a genocidal lunatic terrorist organization\u2026and the people on social media are being used by nefarious forces into becoming useful idiots by reciting Hamas talking points.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a separate Instagram post by Bella and her sister Gigi Hadid, they shared a quote from @daliaskitchen.\n\n\"One cannot advocate for racial equality, LGBT & women's rights, condemn corrupt & abusive regimes and other injustices yet choose to ignore the Palestinian oppression.\"\n\nBut Tishby countered that \"Israel is the only country [in the Middle East] where you can make out with your same-sex partner and not be killed.\"",

            "content": "Queer and transgender people of color perpetually ask whether our deviance from expected ways of loving, living and being in our bodies renders us disgusting, frightening \u2014 even monstrous. Amid parades and rainbow-clad products, this is a line of inquiry approached in private. It is a tally of aberrance that we perform in our darkest hours, when families of origin and childhood friends remind us, yet again, of our undeniable difference. Akwaeke Emezi\u2019s fourth book, \u201cDear Senthuran: A Black Spirit Memoir,\u201d provides this perennial question with a definitive answer. Yes, the author seems to say, we are monsters. But only if monstrosity is defined as the explicit refusal to abide by the binaries that surround us. In a world predisposed to queer villainy, \u201cDear Senthuran\u201d claims monstrosity as a space of intentional rejection.\n\nThe book is a metaphysical journey told through Igbo cosmology. Emezi, who grew up in Aba, Nigeria, invites the reader to \u201cimagine being ogbanje, like me.\u201d Divine spirits born to human mothers, ogbanje are liminal deities in constant transit. In order to rejoin the spirit world, they die over and over again, deliberately leaving their human families bereft.\n\nIn context and content, \u201cDear Senthuran\u201d is molded by departure and what it requires. The book is structured as a series of letters from the author to their friends, lovers, other writers, divine and human family. In them Emezi recounts episodes in their life, from their gender confirmation surgeries to purchasing a home (a place they call their \u201cgodhouse\u201d), to betrayal at the hands of literary mentors. Each letter chronicles a tension \u2014 between Western constructions of gender and \u201cpeople like me: embodied but not human, terrified that they\u2019re going mad, unable to talk about it, and estranged from the Indigenous Black realities that might make some sense of it all.\u201d But also between the euphoria and heartbreak of love, professional triumph and personal failure, the finality of life and death. Emezi proves these oppositions artificial, while establishing the very real solitude and weight of being uninterested in them. Incrementally, the chapters inch closer and closer to a frightening reality. \u201cThere is something bright and brilliant in me,\u201d they write. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel special. It makes me terribly alone.\u201d",

            "content": "With the rush on among companies to deliver on net-zero commitments, the question now becomes\u2014how will they do it?\n\nNet-zero emissions\u2014the goal of decarbonizing our economy by bringing our emissions to zero by 2050 or earlier\u2014is essential to preventing the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nMaking net-zero commitments is one thing. Figuring out the concrete strategies and investments for how your business will achieve those goals and the science-based milestones needed along the way is another. That is where the hard work is starting now for many companies.\n\nOne issue generating a lot of debate is the role and use of natural climate solutions in corporate commitments. Natural climate solutions, such as restoring forests and wetlands, reducing deforestation and farming more sustainably, are one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Other solutions for removing CO2 rely on technologies, including direct air carbon capture, that are expensive and must overcome significant barriers to be deployed at scale. By contrast, companies can adopt natural climate solutions right now\u2014and at a fraction of the estimated cost of other approaches.\n\nThis is partly why increasingly we\u2019re seeing businesses setting net-zero climate commitments that rely on natural climate solutions. A Ceres review of 45 corporate net-zero target announcements between November 2020 and March 2021 found that 44% said they would use natural climate solutions in some way to meet the targets, either by supporting actions within their value chains or by purchasing carbon credits.\n\nHowever, recent reports have called into question the value of some nature-based carbon credits, creating concern that NCS projects may inflate the projected emissions reductions that they promise while another forest carbon credit project led to the removal of Indigenous people from their land.\n\nLet us be clear: natural climate solutions have a role to play. Protecting and restoring forests and other natural ecosystems could deliver as much as a third of the climate mitigation needed to limit global temperature rise in line with the Paris Agreement. And frankly, they will be necessary. Projections show that without natural climate solutions, emissions will not be reduced enough to reach the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature threshold that is required to reverse global warming.\n\nDone right, natural climate solutions won\u2019t just help companies mitigate climate change, they can also help protect and improve biodiversity, fresh water and healthy soil, which all underpin our society and economy. Done justly, they can create new sources of income for rural landowners and secure land rights for native and indigenous communities.\n\nYet, the frequency with which they\u2019re popping up in net-zero commitments underscores a very real risk\u2014that natural climate solutions are being seen as a magic bullet. Relying too much on offsetting carbon emissions instead of lowering them could actually end up compromising our ability to limit warming.\n\nThe bottom line is that natural climate solutions have a clear but limited role in corporate climate commitments. Using them to offset emissions is not a substitute for rapid and deep decarbonization.\n\nThis is exactly why now is the time to lay out clear guardrails for natural climate solutions. Ones that ensure that companies use this approach to raise the ambition of their corporate commitments rather than dilute them. And that will help businesses\u2014and their investors\u2014avoid the pitfalls of using them as crutches, including greenwashing or harming the communities they are expected to help.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ceres, along with its partner IIGCC, just released a new resource: The Role of Natural Climate Solutions in Corporate Climate Commitments, a first-of-its-kind engagement tool developed for investors that provides clear guidance on how they can engage with portfolio companies, and calls for critical guardrails to natural climate solutions.\n\nThese guardrails come down to three basic principles: companies should use these strategies in a way that raises the ambition of their climate commitments; the natural climate solutions they use must provide credible climate change mitigation and these strategies have to provide social and environmental benefits. In order to assess the success of these principles, investors must demand radical transparency in the use of natural climate solutions in net-zero action plans.\n\nAs investors continue to ramp up the pressure to bring more companies into the net-zero fold through powerful initiatives such as Climate Action 100+, they will also need to focus on ensuring their portfolio companies are putting in place smart climate action plans for achieving their goals.\n\nNatural climate solutions will be a critical part of those action plans and how companies get to net zero. Investors have a powerful opportunity to help companies avoid climate-related and reputational risks and instead, help them make sure their commitments deliver on their projected promises to cut emissions. Because protecting our forests, soil and watersheds not only protects our economy and planet, it also unleashes enormous financial and business opportunities for investors and companies.\n\nMindy Lubber is CEO and president of the sustainability nonprofit Ceres and a founding member of the global steering committee for Climate Action 100+.\n\nJulie Nash, Ph.D., is the program director of food and forests at Ceres.",

            "content": "On June 28 a zebra cobra snake on the loose in a Raleigh, North Carolina, neighborhood terrified local residents. Police had sent out an advisory for residents to avoid the venomous reptile after it escaped from a neighbor's house where it was living.\n\nThe zebra cobra was found on June 30, and safely removed from a neighborhood that had been on snake watch for two days.\n\nFollowing the escape, state lawmakers are calling for stricter laws against owning venomous snakes. North Carolina state Sen. Jay Chaudhuri wrote on Twitter that he and several others are concerned the state's current laws aren't enough.\n\nVenomous snake roaming North Carolina suburbs:Experts say one bite or spit may be fatal\n\nUnexpected visitor at the mall:Search continues after 12-foot python escapes from enclosure at Louisiana mall\n\nChaudhuri said the law should require venomous snake owners to register their animals, calling it \"a pretty common-sense solution\" to the problem.\n\n\"It's time to ask whether we should amend our #ncga laws on venomous snakes. I've heard from a number of constituents (#ZebraCobra calls Senate District 15 home) expressing concerns about our law,\" Chaudhuri wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe zebra cobra was revealed to belong to TikTok user Christopher Gifford whose videos highlight his venomous snake collection.\n\nNorth Carolina law allows people to own venomous snakes as long as the owner keeps the reptile in an escape-proof enclosure. The law says the owner must have an escape plan if the animal escapes, including the location of a suitable antivenin.\n\nNorth Carolina residents are also limited to owning no more than five of its native venomous snakes, according to the Charlotte News Observer. This limit doesn't apply to African cobras or vipers that aren't indigenous to the state.\n\nToilet surprise:Man bitten by python in the toilet after it escapes from neighbor's home\n\nThe News Observer reported that the current state law was written in 1950 in response to \"snake handling.\" Snake handling was used by preachers and some members of congregations to prove their faith by handling venomous snakes.\n\nIn 2016, a former UNC-Chapel Hill student and snake enthusiast was bitten by his pet king cobra and nearly died. It was later discovered that he owned more than 20 snakes at the time. He was sentenced to two years of probation for not having the reptiles in properly secured enclosures.",

            "description": "Genetically modified salmon head to US dinner plates  Fox News",
            "content": "The inaugural harvest of genetically modified salmon began this week after the pandemic delayed the sale of the first such altered animal to be cleared for human consumption in the United States, company officials said.\n\nSeveral tons of salmon, engineered by biotech company AquaBounty Technologies Inc., will now head to restaurants and away-from-home dining services \u2014 where labeling as genetically engineered is not required \u2014 in the Midwest and along the East Coast, company CEO Sylvia Wulf said.\n\nThus far, the only customer to announce it is selling the salmon is Samuels and Son Seafood, a Philadelphia-based seafood distributor.\n\nAquaBounty has raised its faster-growing salmon at an indoor aquaculture farm in Albany, Indiana. The fish are genetically modified to grow twice as fast as wild salmon, reaching market size \u2014 8 to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kilograms) \u2014 in 18 months rather than 36.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based company originally planned to harvest the fish in late 2020. Wulf attributed delays to reduced demand and market price for Atlantic salmon spurred by the pandemic.\n\n\"The impact of COVID caused us to rethink our initial timeline ..no one was looking for more salmon then,\" she said. \"We're very excited about it now. We\u2019ve timed the harvest with the recovery of the economy, and we know that demand is going to continue to increase.\"\n\nAlthough finally making its way to dinner plates, the genetically modified fish has been met by pushback from environmental advocates for years.\n\nThe international food service company Aramark in January announced its commitment to not sell such salmon, citing environmental concerns and potential impacts on Indigenous communities that harvest wild salmon.\n\nThe announcement followed similar ones by other major food service companies \u2014 Compass Group and Sodexo \u2014 and many large U.S. grocery retailers, seafood companies and restaurants. Costco, Kroger, Walmart and Whole Foods maintain that they don\u2019t sell genetically modified or cloned salmon and would need to label them as such.\n\nThe boycott against AquaBounty salmon has largely come from activists with the Block Corporate Salmon campaign, which aims to protect wild salmon and preserve Indigenous rights to practice sustainable fishing.\n\n\"Genetically engineered salmon is a huge threat to any vision of a healthy food system. People need ways to connect with the food they\u2019re eating, so they know where it\u2019s coming from,\" said Jon Russell, a member of the campaign and a food justice organizer with Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance. \"These fish are so new \u2014 and there\u2019s such a loud group of people who oppose it. That's a huge red flag to consumers.\"\n\nWulf said she\u2019s confident there's an appetite for the fish.\n\n\"Most of the salmon in this country is imported, and during the pandemic, we couldn\u2019t get products into the market,\" Wulf said. \"So, having a domestic source of supply that isn\u2019t seasonal like wild salmon and that is produced in a highly-controlled, bio-secure environment is increasingly important to consumers.\"\n\nAquaBounty markets the salmon as disease- and antibiotic-free, saying its product comes with a reduced carbon footprint and none of the risk of polluting marine ecosystems like traditional sea-cage farming carries.\n\nDespite their rapid growth, the genetically modified salmon require less food than most farmed Atlantic salmon, the company says. Biofiltration units keep water in the Indiana facility\u2019s many 70,000-gallon (264,979-liter) tanks clean, making fish less likely to get sick or require antibiotics.\n\nThe FDA approved the AquAdvantage Salmon as \"safe and effective\" in 2015. It was the only genetically modified animal approved for human consumption until federal regulators approved a genetically modified pig for food and medical products in December.\n\nIn 2018, the federal agency greenlit AquaBounty\u2019s sprawling Indiana facility, which is currently raising roughly 450 tons (408 metric tons) of salmon from eggs imported from Canada but is capable of raising more than twice that amount.\n\nBut in a shifting domestic market that increasingly values origin, health and sustainability, and wild over farmed seafood, others have a different view of the salmon, which some critics have nicknamed \"Frankenfish.\"\n\nPart of the domestic pushback revolves around how the engineered fish is to be labeled under FDA guidelines. Salmon fishermen, fish farmers, wholesalers and other stakeholders want clear labeling practices to ensure that customers know they're purchasing an engineered product.\n\nUSDA labeling law directs companies to disclose genetically-modified ingredients in food through use of a QR code, an on-package display of text or a designated symbol. Mandatory compliance with that regulation takes full effect in January, but the rules don\u2019t apply to restaurants or food services.\n\nWulf said the company is committed to using \"genetically engineered\" labeling when its fish are sold in grocery stores in coming months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn November, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco affirmed that the FDA had the authority to oversee genetically engineered animals and fish. But he ruled that the agency hadn't adequately assessed the environmental consequences of AquaBounty salmon escaping into the wild.\n\nThe company argued that escape is unlikely, saying the fish are monitored 24 hours a day and contained in tanks with screens, grates, netting, pumps and chemical disinfection to prevent escape. The company\u2019s salmon are also female and sterile, preventing them from mating.\n\n\"Our fish are actually designed to thrive in the land-based environment. That's part of what makes them unique,\" Wulf said. \"And we\u2019re proud of the fact that genetically engineered allows us to bring more of a healthy nutritious product to market in a safe, secure and sustainable way.\"",

            "content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Democrat Melanie Stansbury has won election to Congress for New Mexico to fill a vacant seat previously held by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.\n\nStanbury prevailed Tuesday in a four-way race after campaigning in support of major initiatives of the Biden administration.\n\nStansbury closely aligned her message to voters with proposed and enacted Democratic legislation on pandemic relief, infrastructure spending and interventions to slow climate change. Her victory shores up the Democratic majority in Congress ahead of 2022 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cOur leadership in the House and Senate is working really hard to make sure that we can actually pass something this year so that we can bring money home for critical infrastructure,\u201d Stanbury said during the final hours of voting. \u201cAnd this is especially important for New Mexico because it includes funding for things like broadband and clean energy.\u201d\n\nStansbury defeated third-term Republican state Sen. Mark Moores to fill an Albuquerque-based seat that has been held by Democrats since 2009.\n\nMoores highlighted concerns about crime in Albuquerque and has painted his Democratic opponent as a progressive with a radical agenda to defund traditional police agencies.\n\nStanbury\u2019s victory preserves an all-female House delegation for the state.\n\nLibertarian nominee Chris Manning and independent Aubrey Dunn Jr. campaigned unsuccessfully for the vacant 1st Congressional District seat.\n\nThe 1st Congressional District encompasses Albuquerque, rural Torrance County and other outlying areas that include the Indigenous community of Sandia Pueblo.\n\nThe district\u2019s voters have heavily favored Democratic candidates in recent years, shunning former President Donald Trump with a gap of 23 percentage points in 2020 and reelecting Haaland with a margin of 16 percentage points as voter participation reached an all-time high.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election is among a handful of races to fill vacancies in Congress ahead of 2022 midterm elections. Democrats held a 219-211 majority in Congress going into Tuesday\u2019s vote in New Mexico.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s 1st District seat has consistently been a stepping stone to higher office for Republican and Democratic politicians, including now-deceased Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., former U.S. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\nThe district relies heavily on federal military and research funding as home to Kirtland Air Force Base and Sandia National Laboratories.\n\nTrump in 2020 fell flat with Albuquerque-area voters after he sent federal agents to bolster local law enforcement efforts.\n\nRepublicans last year flipped the state\u2019s sprawling 2nd Congressional District in southern New Mexico as Yvette Herrell of Alamogordo ousted incumbent U.S. Rep. Xochitl Torres Small.",

            "content": "Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren blasted the Biden administration in her \"Final Thoughts\" Friday for blocking fireworks at Mount Rushmore over Fourth of July weekend\n\n\"As a proud native of the great state of South Dakota, I must say it is an absolute abomination the Biden administration blocked the fireworks show that was set to take place at Mt. Rushmore this Independence Day weekend,\" she said.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has told Fox News that following President Biden\u2019s election, the National Park Service has denied her permit request to have fireworks at Mt. Rushmore, citing environmental and indigenous rights concerns. Lahren didn't buy it.\n\n\"This is Biden\u2019s America now, and in Biden\u2019s America, all fun, festive and patriotic things are pooped on,\" she said.\n\nThe Fox Nation host said the Biden administration\u2019s reasoning for not granting the permit was \"a \u2018B\u2019 for \u2018BS\u2019.\"\n\n\"Naw, I think it is much more likely that this decision was politically motivated,\" she continued.\n\n\"Our belief is truly that it was political,\" Gov. Noem told Fox News. \"I believe the Biden administration pulled the fireworks from us to be punitive. They did not like us hosting it last year in the middle of COVID.\"\n\n\"They did not like the fact that President Trump was here celebrating with us,\" she continued. \"They\u2019re doing it for arbitrary reasons.\"\n\n\"Yup, methinks that has a whole heck of a lot to do with it,\" Lahren agreed. \"It\u2019s not \u2018en vogue\u2019 to celebrate America, much less the Founding Fathers who helped build it.\"\n\nLahren also noted that Biden\u2019s refusal to allow fireworks could have a negative impact on South Dakota\u2019s economy.\n\n\"Outside of agriculture, tourism is our biggest industry in South Dakota,\" she said. \"By taking away these fireworks the administration is robbing local businesses of a great deal of revenue \u2013 once again punishing the little guy to make a political point.\"\n\n\"What a bummer and what a disappointment,\" she concluded. \"Biden\u2019s America strikes again.\"\n\nThis Independence Day, Fox Nation is honoring all who have served.

            "content": "Hubbard, 43, qualified for the rescheduled Tokyo Games in May after a rule change, which effectively guaranteed her a spot in the super heavyweight category, Reuters reported at the time. This will be her first time at the Olympic Games -- a remarkable comeback after a significant injury in 2018.\n\n\"I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders,\" said Hubbard in the statement.\n\n\"When I broke my arm at the Commonwealth Games three years ago, I was advised that my sporting career had likely reached its end. But your support, your encouragement, and your aroha carried me through the darkness,\" she said, using the Indigenous Maori word for \"love.\"\n\nWeightlifting has been a focus in an ongoing heated debate over transgender athletes competing in women's sports. Dozens of US states are considering legislation that would prevent transgender women and girls from participating in women's categories, with several that have already enacted sports bans this year. Hubbard's participation in women's categories has drawn controversy before -- in 2018, Australia's weightlifting federation sought to block her from competing at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, but organizers rejected the move. And in May, after Hubbard successfully qualified, Belgian weightlifter Anna Vanbellinghen told an Olympics news website the situation was \"unfair\" and \"like a bad joke.\" Hubbard competed in men's weightlifting competitions before transitioning in 2013. She has been eligible to compete in the Olympics since 2015, when the IOC issued new guidelines allowing any transgender athlete to compete as a woman provided their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before their first competition, according to Reuters. The NCAA says it supports transgender student-athletes as some states enact sports bans She has been confirmed eligible this year for the Olympics after meeting criteria by the International Weightlifting Federation, International Olympic Committee, and New Zealand Olympic Committee, said the committee statement on Monday. \"We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,\" said Kereyn Smith, CEO of the New Zealand Olympic Committee, in the statement. \"As the New Zealand Team, we have a strong culture of manaaki and inclusion and respect for all,\" Smith said. \"We are committed to supporting all eligible New Zealand athletes and ensuring their mental and physical wellbeing, along with their high-performance needs, while preparing for and competing at the Olympic Games are met.\"",

            "content": "From newly registered nurses to medical students, a strong pipeline of Black healthcare workers is needed more than ever\n\nWearing an N-95 mask, a full-body yellow gown, and latex gloves, Rebecca Hamilton, a newly registered nurse, was ready for her fourth shift on the medical surgery floor at a local South Florida hospital. Full of nerves and grateful for the opportunities afforded to her, Rebecca's career as a Black registered nurse is beginning at a time when the United States is encountering the dueling pandemics of COVID-19 and racial injustice.\n\nLike so many others entering professions in healthcare, Rebecca is treating patients during a pandemic which has disproportionately claimed the lives of Black, Brown and vulnerable citizens, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I finished my nursing education during a global pandemic. I took my nursing board exam during a global pandemic, and now I'm treating patients on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Rebecca Hamilton, a South Florida native. \"My first priority is learning how to best serve my patients in this direst of circumstances \u2014 especially when far too many of them look like me.\"\n\nHamilton's path to the healthcare industry started with a spark from her late grandmother. As a first-generation American family with Jamaican roots, Hamilton says her family rallied around her grandmother day and night, especially during the illness which caused her death. During that period, Hamilton then a high school student, was responsible for taking her grandmother to doctor's appointments and follow-up visits, and filling prescriptions. This journey as an end-of-life caregiver gave the future registered nurse a front-row seat to see the disparities and changes needed within the healthcare industry for people of color.\n\n\"As my grandmother's illnesses compounded, I saw the healthcare industry from a new set of eyes, those of the Black elderly. With doctors' appointments stacking up one after another, I realized that my grandmother didn't understand what was happening to her. The healthcare professionals in charge of care never took the time out to explain things in a meaningful way. She was left alone in a healthcare system all by herself, and it wasn't right,\u201d said Hamilton.\n\nThis life experience and mentoring from the many Jamaican-trained registered nurses in Hamilton\u2019s tight-knit church community, inspired her shift from an undecided major at Florida Atlantic University to a nursing student at Broward College. \"I was lucky that I started my training before COVID-19 and got a chance to get some real hospital experience before the pandemic hit,\" she said. \u201cNow, I work in a hospital that treats COVID patients and those with COVID results pending. I think about the health and well-being of parents at home and those in my community who have succumbed to this pandemic due to preexisting chronic illnesses.\"\n\nWith her grandmother's praying hand ring on one of her ring finger, Hamilton continues to learn the ropes for a high-demand career filled with opportunity. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has given a voice to nurses and healthcare workers like me,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIn school, we learned about nursing. As a healthcare professional, I'm learning about nursing during a pandemic,\" she continued. \"Nursing and the healthcare industry overall can be difficult and overwhelming at times, but I feel like there are so many opportunities to grow, learn and better serve my community,\u201d she said.\n\nHamilton enters the field amid a nursing shortage and at a time when the Black registered nursing education pipeline has been severely curtailed, a situation likely ensuring less diverse healthcare workforces in the future, to the detriment of Black patients and families.\n\nHealth disparities are a continual problem in the United States. According to Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity at The George Washington University, people of color experience poorer outcomes and shorter life expectancy than their white counterparts. The underrepresentation of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people in many healthcare professions \u2014 including those requiring an advanced degree \u2014 contributes to these health gaps.\n\n\"COVID-19 has made health disparities more evident,\" said Edward Salsberg, a researcher for the Mullan Institute of Health Workforce Equity. \"Having a diverse healthcare workforce is a key component to solving these disparities and ensuring quality healthcare for Black patients, especially with regards to patient communications, preventative care, and patient satisfaction.\"\n\nThese disparities are just one reason Georgetown University School of Medicine's third-year clinical student Malcolm Meredith decided to become a physician. As one of two Black men in his class of more than 200 students, Meredith currently serves as the Student Executive Council president for the Georgetown School of Medicine \u2014 a role held by just a few people of color in the school's 170 years of existence.\n\n\"At one point in time, someone that looked like me couldn't attend the school I attend. Women couldn't attend the school I attend. And, poor folks couldn't attend the school I attend,\" said Meredith. \"We have made some amazing strides since those days, but we still have a lot of work to do. As a clinical student, you can actually see the difference in how patients respond when they see someone that looks like them at the bedside, even if my knowledge is still limited,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorgetown University's School of Medicine has been vocal about racial injustice in America. It has taken an active role to work collaboratively with its student body on issues of diversity and inclusion.\n\nMeredith, also a graduate of Morehouse College and native of LeGrange, Georgia, has had a passion for healthcare since he was a child. Like Hamilton, he was also guided into medicine after watching his grandmother struggle with a chronic healthcare condition.\n\n\"I am going into healthcare, medicine in particular, because I have witnessed first-hand the difference a caring doctor can make in someone's life. Not just in their health, but also in their everyday quality of life,\" Meredith said. \"There is something so fulfilling about using your knowledge of science and medicine to help people live better quality lives,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile most medical students find their journey to be challenging, those who are Black have more significant socioeconomic challenges on top of the emotional and academic demands. These challenges have only been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of racial injustice.\n\n\"Accepting more Black medical students into a program is not enough. To ensure that we have an increase in the number of Black physicians, schools need to work with their current students and help them overcome obstacles while in medical school,\" said Meredith. \"During my experience as a student, I yearned for guidance on balancing my identities of being both Black and a physician-in-training. I have had trouble getting it. And I know my story isn't unique amongst Black med students at this school or other predominantly white institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nMeredith, interested in entering a surgery specialty upon completing medical school, believes the best way to encourage more Black students to enter professions in healthcare is by addressing the issues beyond admissions making the road difficult. Some of those issues he says are: a lack of mentoring programs, insufficient financial assistance, and the need for better awareness of diversity and inclusion throughout the medical education process.\n\n\"As a clinician student and leader on my campus, I want my pathway and story to be an example and beacon of optimism of what is possible,\" Meredith said. \"What has come out of [the] COVID-19 pandemic is more people being committed to doing something, and I hope that younger Black folks will join me in the healthcare profession so we can help the underserved in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nIt looks like Meredith\u2019s hopes are becoming a reality. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), 2020 saw a 10.5 percent increase in Black first-year medical students, and a 12.2 percent increase among Black men enrolling in their first year of medical school. 2020 also saw an estimated 18 to 20 percent increase in the number of Black, Brown, and Indigenous applicants to M.D. granting institutions.\n\nThese are all signs that Norma Poll-Hunter Ph.D., AAMC's senior director of workforce diversity, called promising. \"We see an increase of Black, Brown and Indigenous applicants applying for medical schools [throughout] the United States and in Puerto Rico,\" she said. \"There is also a greater concentration of pipeline and pre-medical programs aimed at eliminating many of the barriers these students face when they decide to pursue a career in medicine,\u201d said Poll-Hunter. \"The role that Black physicians play in the healthcare workforce cannot be understated. They are more likely to locate their practices in underserved communities. They are more likely to serve patients and families on Medicaid. And most importantly, they are more likely to increase healthcare outcomes for people of color,\u201d she said.\n\nImproving healthcare outcomes will require breaking down the lingering distrust in the healthcare industry by the Black community. With that mistrust at an all time high, adding more Black professionals in the healthcare industry might be key to putting Black patients at ease. \"There is a lot of mistrust in our healthcare system, especially amongst people of color, '' said Poll-Hunter. \"This mistrust can only be broken down if more Black people get into the field of patient care and at the decision-making table,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Rebecca Hamilton and Malcolm Meredith are shining examples of young Black people answering the call to serve their community in the healthcare profession.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic seemingly comes to an end, the racial injustice pandemic continues. With healthcare workers still standing on the frontlines, the question remains of whether the representation and lived experience of Black physicians, nurses, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, advanced practice registered nurses, and other healthcare professionals be valued.",

            "content": "A handbook with guidance for reopening schools prepared by the Biden administration included a hyperlink to a radical group called the Abolitionist Teaching Network that advocates for teachers to \u201cdisrupt Whiteness and other forms of oppression.\u201d\n\nA report from Fox News outlines the controversial positions of the group promoted by the Department of Education, including doing away with \u201call punitive or disciplinary practices that spirit murder Black, Brown, and Indigenous children\u201d in classrooms.\n\nThe Abolitionist Teaching Network has a list of \u201cdemands\u201d on its website including \u201c[f]ree, antiracist therapy for White educators and support staff,\u201d and its co-founder Bettina Love has said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t recognize that White supremacy is in everything we do, then we got a problem,\u201d adding, \u201cI want us to be feared.\u201d\n\nLove also said her network would \u201ccreate a national database of antiracist school counselors, therapists and lawyers,\u201d and would make available \u201cactivists in residence\u201d for school districts deemed to be in need of them.\n\nThe activist in residence position is advertised on the website as a $30,000-a-year job with 20 hours of work a week that includes canvassing as well as \u201ccreating media and propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe controversial group was linked to by the DOE in its reopening handbook in a section related to students\u2019 academic, social and emotional needs. President Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan provided $122 billion of aid to schools, 20% of which must go to programs such as those offered by the Abolitionist Teaching Network.\n\nAfter declining to respond to Fox News prior to the publication of the story, the DOE scrambled to explain its actions Wednesday in a statement that read, \u201cThe Department does not endorse the recommendations of this group, nor do they reflect our policy positions. It was an error in a lengthy document to include this citation.\u201d\n\nThe bombshell story represents a new turn in the debate over critical race theory in US schools. Though the Abolitionist Teaching Network does not use that precise term, its racial rhetoric is consistent with CRT, which several states are working to remove from school curriculums.\n\nDespite the DOE\u2019s denial that it supports the policies of the group it promoted in its handbook, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month that there is \u201csystemic racism\u201d in American learning institutions that must be addressed.\n\nIt is not clear how many of the over 10,000 school districts that received the DOE handbook have sought services from the Abolitionist Teaching Network, but its website offers links for training such as \u201cResources for Agitators\u201d and \u201cRadical Self Care.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Fox News story, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted, \u201cThe Biden White House is ruled by the radical left \u2013 and they will stop at nothing to brainwash our kids through Critical Race Theory.\u201d",

The bombshell story represents a new turn in the debate over critical race theory in US schools. Though the Abolitionist Teaching Network does not use that precise term, its racial rhetoric is consistent with CRT, which several states are working to remove from school curriculums.\n\nDespite the DOE\u2019s denial that it supports the policies of the group it promoted in its handbook It is not clear how many of the over 10,000 school districts that received the DOE handbook have sought services from the Abolitionist Teaching Network, but its website offers links for training such as \u201cResources for Agitators\u201d and \u201cRadical Self Care.\u201d",

The rest will come from private donations from various trusts and foundations.\n\nHOMELESSNESS IN NEW YORK CITY: HERE ARE THE STATISTICS\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the cash \"will help uplift young people and reinforces our commitment to ending youth homelessness once and for all.\"\n\n\"A Recovery for All of Us requires embracing innovating solutions to our most pressing challenges,\" he insisted in a statement.\n\n\"New York City is the place many young people from towns and cities across the country look to for hope and a home, particularly LGBTQI youth who disproportionately experience physical and mental health challenges, and higher rates of homelessness and unemployment,\" McCray said.\n\nThe study was developed by Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago and Point Source Youth, which said in a joint release that \"direct cash transfer programs are supported by a vast international evidence base.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Contrary to common beliefs, studies show that cash transfers to people experiencing adversity do not result in money poorly spent, increased substance use, or reduced motivation to work,\" the release stated.\n\n\"Evaluations have found that recipients mostly spend cash assistance on basic needs, that the financial support has helped people engage in education and productive employment, and that these programs tend to reduce risky behaviors and negative health outcomes.\"\n\nClick to read more of the",

            "content": "Starting this fall, Davidson College will be offering a course titled \"#Abolishthepolice: Race and Policing in the U.S.\"\n\nThe \"critical Black studies\" course aims to take a philosophical look at the relationship between Blackness and policing in the U.S., according to a course description.\n\nIt will enlist \"Black political and feminist theories\" and social and political philosophies to \"critically examine and think through issues of race, criminalization, incarceration, police militarization, predictive policing, surveillance, and domestic security.\"\n\nThe course, first reported by Campus Reform, will satisfy the requirements of social and scientific thought and for Africana and Sociology majors.\n\nThe course description cites \"numerous experts\" who have shown that the U.S. has the highest rate of police violence and incarceration as well as \"scholars\" who have shown that \"Black, brown, and indigenous people are disproportionate police targets.\"\n\nMORE FACT CHECKERS SHOULD HIT DEMOCRATIC \u2018LIE\u2019 THAT GOP DEFUNDED THE POLICE: MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER\n\n\"[B]ecause police violence and gendered violence are intrinsically connected, Black trans and gender nonconforming people, and Black people with disabilities and mental health issues, routinely experience surveillance, arrest, incarceration, and sexual assault at the hands of law enforcement at significantly higher rates than any other racial demographic,\" the course description says.\n\nIt further suggests that \"current mainstream conversations\" are putting too much emphasis on reforming the police to \"lessen harm against marginalized communities.\"\n\n\"I suggest we begin elsewhere. To understand the root causes of policing, I propose we begin with a deceptively simple question: What is policing?\"\n\nFox News has reached out to the course instructor, Claudia Garcia-Rojas, but did not hear back before publication.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Davidson's Director of Media Relations Jay Pfeifer said the school is a \"student-focused institution of higher learning, grounded in the Christian Reformed Tradition and therefore faithful to a God bound by no church or creed.\"\n\n\"We explore all reality through unlimited employment of our intellectual powers. That same faith tradition extends our loyalty to the whole of humanity. We value diversity and respect the world\u2019s various religious traditions. We honor the dignity and worth of every person. We focus on studies that are liberating and dedicate ourselves to the quest for truth. The offering of any class, whatever its title, reflects that it covers a subject worth studying. Grounded in these values, Davidson assists students in developing humane instincts and disciplined and creative minds for lives of leadership and service. We hope our graduates think clearly, make relevant value judgments, discriminate among values, and communicate freely in the realm of ideas.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimilarly, Bard College, a New York liberal arts college, is offering a course this fall on how to \"sell\" the abolition of prisons.\n\nThe \"Abolishing Prisons and the Police\" class being offered at Bard College will teach students how to \"sell\" abolition to the masses and design a multi-media ad campaign to make prison abolition go viral,\" according to a course description.",

            "description": "WNBA star Liz Cambage blasts Australian Olympic Committee for 'whitewashing,' threatens Tokyo boycott  USA TODAY",
            "content": "Australian women's basketball player Liz Cambage threatened to boycott this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo after a promotional photo shoot for her country omitted any Olympians of color \u2014 including herself.\n\nCambage vented on Instagram that the Australian Olympic Committee's photo shoot was \"whitewashed.\" The photo showcased several white athletes sporting apparel for sponsor Jockey.\n\nCambage, who plays for the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces and was a key member of Australia's 2012 Olympic bronze medalist team, felt the image was representative of a bigger problem.\n\n\"If I've said it once I've said it a million times,\" she began on her Instragram rant. \"HOW AM I MEANT TO REPRESENT A COUNTRY THAT DOESNT EVEN REPRESENT ME #whitewashedaustralia.\"\n\nCambage added: \"Y'all really do anything to remove POCs (people of colour) from the forefront when it's black athletes leading the pack. Until I see you doing more @ausolympicteam imma sit this one out.\"\n\nIn a public statement, the Australian Olympic Committee acknowledged Cambage's comments, apologized and said the Jockey photo shoot \"should have better reflected the rich diversity of athletes who represent Australia at the Olympic Games.\"\n\n\"We proudly defend our track record on diversity and there will be further photoshoots that reflect our broad diversity of athletes,\" the statement added.\n\nCambage directed a portion of her frustration with Jockey, writing Friday on social media: \u201cThe whitewashing is sad. ...Jockey Australia, you knew exactly what you were doing. You need me to send you a list of all the POC athletes that are trying to make it to the Olympics right now that you could use? I can do it!\u201d\n\nMessages made by USA TODAY Sports to Jockey were not immediately returned.\n\nFormer Australian women's national team coach Tom Maher told The Australian that Cambage was \"making a big deal out of pretty much nothing.\"\n\n\u201cThere have been no bad intentions,\" he said. \"Was there a homosexual athlete represented? Was there a Chinese Australian athlete mentioned? I mean, where does it end?\"\n\nCambage, who was born in London to a Nigerian father and Australian mother, took a shot at a previous photo of Australian Olympians \u2014 all but one athlete white in the image while wearing the country's uniforms. She wrote on Instagram: \"Also fake tan doesn't equal diversity.\" One of the athletes was rugby player Maurice Longbottom, who is Indigenous.\n\nCambage later said on Instagram: \"To Mr. Longbottom, I'm sorry that you got caught up in this. I did not think you had a fake tan on. I was never saying that. I was saying that for the rest of the photo. One POC in a photo is not good enough for me.\"\n\nCambage, the No. 2 pick in the 2011 WNBA draft, currently holds the WNBA's single-game scoring record with her 53-point performance against the New York Liberty in July of 2018. The 6-foot-8 center is a three-time All-Star and took a five-year hiatus from the league to focus on her overseas career.",

            "description": "Teachers union vows to defend critical race theory in classrooms: 'Truth is not radical'  Washington Times",
            "content": "One of the nation\u2019s largest teachers unions vowed Tuesday to go to court to allow the teaching of critical race theory.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers, said in a speech that she considers teaching critical race theory to be teaching \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMark my words. Our union will defend any member who gets in trouble for teaching honest history. We have a legal defense fund ready to go. Teaching the truth is not radical or wrong. Distorting history and threatening educators for teaching the truth is what is truly radical and wrong,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said at the union\u2019s virtual professional development conference.\n\n\u201cCulture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as critical race theory, to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history. This harms students. These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history. This will put students at a disadvantage in life by knocking a big hole in their understanding of this country and the world,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Weingarten\u2019s vow comes just days after the 3 million-member National Education Association\u2019s representative assembly adopted as the union\u2019s official position that it is \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d to teach the theory. Union spokeswoman Staci Maiers said the body has 8,000 delegates from across the country.\n\n\u201cPublicly (through existing media) convey its support for the accurate and honest teaching of social studies topics, including truthful and age-appropriate accountings of unpleasant aspects of American history, such as slavery, and the oppression and discrimination of Indigenous, Black, Brown, and other peoples of color, as well as the continued impact this history has on our current society,\u201d the union\u2019s official position says.\n\nNEA President Becky Pringle also defended the teaching of critical race theory in an op-ed in USA Today last week. \u201cWe can teach about the horrors of slavery, internment and forced resettlement. We can have honest discussions about today\u2019s injustices and the threats to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that still exist for many. We can objectively present to students the good, bad and ugly of our past so that they can build a better, brighter future. Our students need to learn about the times when this country has lived up to its promise, and when it has not,\u201d she wrote.\u201d\n\nThe theory, created by leftist legal academics, argues that laws and policies from the past continue to discriminate against Black people and other people of color.\n\nCritics say it is racially divisive and presents an inaccurate view of the U.S. as a racist nation.\n\nAt least six states, including Texas, have barred teaching it.\n\nThe spreading of the theory in recent years ignited a searing debate. Conservatives condemned the Biden administration for backing the theory \u2014 including the idea that Whites are privileged due to their race. Most notably, the administration has proposed giving school districts federal grants to incorporate in K-12 curriculum. Critics like Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, also condemned its teaching in the military, saying it will create tensions between soldiers.",

            "description": "Many North American birds bear names with racist roots. That's beginning to change  CNN",
            "content": "Bird Names for Birds is a grassroots initiative aiming to change eponymous common names of birds, specifically in North America, arguing that many have been named after problematic people.\n\nTake the Hammond's flycatcher, named for William Alexander Hammond, a former US surgeon general, said Jordan Rutter, co-founder of the initiative. Hammond, Rutter said, attempted to collect brains of killed Indigenous people for study, and also wrote that Black people were \"little elevated in mental or physical faculties above the monkey of an organ grinder,\" as noted on the initiative's website.\n\nRutter said the initiative identified a list of 150 birds in North America named after people and that it is attempting to get those names changed. The effort goes beyond \"just the window dressing of bird names,\" said Rutter. \"We're really calling for a change in the process.\"\n\nLast year, supporters of bird name changes saw one victory when the American Ornithological Society renamed McCown's longspur -- after Confederate Gen. John Porter McCown -- as the thick-billed longspur.\n\nA bird named for a Confederate general officially has a new identity On Tuesday, there was another step forward. The AOS announced a new ad hoc committee that would make recommendations for guidelines on how to identify and change \"harmful English bird names,\" according to a statement by the organization . The committee is set to have specific recommendations by early 2022. \"We are excited to put this important task into the hands of our ad hoc committee, and look forward to receiving their recommendations on the process for reviewing and changing English bird names to ensure ornithology and birding are as inclusive as possible,\" the AOS said in the statement. Ultimately, Bird Names for Birds wants to make the system across the board more inclusive. While changing the name of McCown's longspur to thick-billed longspur was great, it only represented the tip of the iceberg, Rutter said, noting that the AOS previously rejected the same proposal in 2018. \"Nothing about the process changed,\" she said, adding that more can be done to amplify non-White birders' perspectives. In response, the AOS said it has been \"discussing in earnest the issue of eponymous bird names\" since the initial rejection in 2018. \"The American Ornithological Society (AOS) acknowledges the systemic barriers faced by scientists of color, who have been largely underrepresented in STEM disciplines and, specifically, in avian systematics. AOS unequivocally supports increasing diversity and inclusion in ornithology and is committed to anti-racism,\" the organization said in a statement to CNN. The issue of renaming is not a new one. Symbols and names linked to the Confederacy are being removed across the country. This month, a school board in Florida voted to rename six schools previously bearing the names of Confederate leaders. An Atlanta board of education made a similar decision in April And of course, one of the most high profile of these changes has been the Washington Football Team's renaming , which came after years of campaigning by Native Americans, who called out the team's formerly racist name.",

            "content": "Android users in the USA can join the invite-only Clubhouse, more than a year after the social audio app debuted.\n\nAt its weekly \"town hall\" meeting Sunday, Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth are likely to announce that the popular app will be available for American Android users in beta mode.\n\n\"With Android, we believe that Clubhouse will feel more complete. We are so grateful to all of the Android users out there for their patience,\" Davison and Seth said in a company blog post. \"Whether you are a creator, a club organizer, or someone who just wants to explore, we are so excited to welcome you to the community.\"\n\nClubhouse's Android arrival comes after more than 10 million downloads on Apple's operating system.\n\nRecognizing a video game pioneer:USC fund for Black and Indigenous students honors Black engineer who changed video games\n\nLost no more:Are you the forgetful type? Here are 5 ways tech can help find your phone, keys, parked car or pet\n\nFacebook said last month it will soon roll out a series of audio features including Live Audio Rooms that allow users to listen and participate in live conversations, similar to Clubhouse, and Soundbites, in which users can create and share short audio clips. Last week, Twitter announced its audio chat product called Spaces for users who have more than 600 followers.\n\nThe anticipated competition for Clubhouse appears after the social audio phenomenon exploded during the pandemic as people looked for ways to socialize with each other besides video chats and conference calls.\n\nAt Clubhouse, members can feel like they are either eavesdropping on conversations or exchanging ideas with power players and celebs \u2013 for free. Chats can go on for hours in a world mostly frustrated and weary with being socially isolated and worn out from attending videoconference meetings all day long.\n\nClubhouse has grown exponentially since last fall with such notables as Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey and even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company admitted in its blog Sunday that \"the load stressed our systems \u2013 causing widespread server outages and notification failures, and surpassing the limits of our early discovery algorithms.\"\n\nDavison and Seth have repeatedly said the company has to focus on hiring help to fix its issues instead of adding features. \"It was an important time of investment, which we think will help us serve the community much better in the long run,\" the founders said in the blog post.\n\nClubhouse said it will soon allow Android users in other English-speaking countries, then globally. The company said it will continue to get feedback, add users on the waitlist to join the app on Apple's iOS and eventually add features such as payments and club creation.\n\nThe company said it has seen global growth in its chat rooms, including rural Georgia farmers interacting with entrepreneurs in Tanzania, film clubs forming in India, debate rooms in Germany and quiz shows originating in the Middle East.\n\n\"We've seen firsthand what we\u2019ve always believed \u2013 that the need to gather with other humans is universal,\" the company blog said. \"Throughout this period, we have felt the need to be cross-platform more strongly than ever.\"",

            "description": "Push to change Indian-themed team names stalls one year after Washington took action  Washington Times",
            "content": "Last summer\u2019s decision by Washington\u2018s NFL franchise to abandon the \u201cRedskins\u201d brand was seen not only as a victory for those who had spent years protesting that specific name, but as a sign of broader change to come. Activists hoped that other American Indian-themed teams would follow suit.\n\nBut if owner Dan Snyder\u2018s decision to wave the white flag in his battle with critics of the team\u2019s historic nickname was the start of a trend, it\u2019s a slow-moving one.\n\nTuesday marks the official one-year anniversary of Washington retiring the old name, but only MLB\u2019s Cleveland Indians have gone through with a similar announcement. Three other teams in major professional sports that feature American Indian names and mascots \u2014 the NFL\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs, NHL\u2019s Chicago Blackhawks and MLB\u2019s Atlanta Braves \u2014 resisted overtures to rebrand.\n\nActivists say be patient. The changes in Washington and Cleveland were years in the works.\n\nCarla Fredericks, CEO of The Christensen Fund, a nonprofit aimed at helping American Indians, said she believes change \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum\u201d \u2014 adding that the overall equality movement for Indigenous people goes beyond the realm of sports. But she called Washington\u2019s decision to move on from Redskins \u201cimportant,\u201d given the decades-long fight surrounding it.\n\nShe said there was significance in the fact Washington was the first to act, too.\n\n\u201cIronically, [the Washington Football Team] set a really good example for these other teams,\u201d Fredericks said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why these other teams are really still entrenching themselves with these views, names that are part of a bygone era in American race relations.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Fredericks was one of the leaders of a group of investment firms that pressed FedEx, Pepsi and Nike \u2014 all major sponsors of the Burgundy and Gold \u2014 to sever ties with the football franchise unless the team rebranded. The pressure followed: FedEx threatened to end its naming rights agreement at the team\u2019s stadium in Landover, Maryland, while Nike and a slew of other retailers stopped selling the team\u2019s merchandise.\n\nThe threat to the team\u2019s bottom line worked. When Washington put out a 100-word statement to announce the news, \u201csponsors\u201d were listed twice \u2014 each time before \u201cfans and community.\u201d\n\nTeams like the Chiefs and the Braves haven\u2019t seen that kind of pressure from their business partners. Nike never pulled Chiefs gear, and United Airlines hasn\u2019t threatened to stop sponsoring the United Center, the home of the Blackhawks.\n\nInstead, the Blackhawks said they would invest more resources into the American Indian community and banned fans from wearing headdresses at future home games.\n\nThe Chiefs also put restrictions on headdresses, while the Braves said last July they were focused on creating a \u201cstronger bond\u201d with American Indian tribes. Neither the Chiefs nor the Braves, however, have banned the \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d \u2014 the crowd-fueled gesture fans at home games use to show their support for the teams. Some insist the gesture itself is offensive.\n\nWashington team president Jason Wright, looking back over the last year, told The Washington Times recently that the name ultimately needed to change because of \u201cits use of Native American imagery and racialized language.\u201d For years, the Redskins in particular had been the main focus of activist groups as many considered the moniker to be a racial slur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret why we began this journey\u201d to rebrand, Wright said.\n\nWhile the team weighs possible new nicknames \u2014 the Washington Post reported over the weekend that the team expects to unveil a new name and logo early next year \u2014 Wright said the franchise is determined to build a beneficial relationship with American Indian leaders, no matter what their new name ends up being.\n\nHe declined to mention who specifically the team spoke with, but reiterated that the team\u2019s new look would not contain any references to American Indian imagery. He added there was a consensus that it would be the \u201cright path.\n\n\u201cThis process has exposed to us the very deeply-held personal feelings about our previous imagery and association,\u201d Wright said.\n\nSo, does Wright believe that American Indian imagery needs to go throughout sports?\n\n\u201cIn this moment, for our team, it is important to prioritize the views of those who have been disenfranchised and hurt by our historical use of Native American imagery and associations,\u201d Wright said. \u201cEach team has to go through their own process, and we are mindful that in many ways we\u2019re writing the playbook for other organizations, who are facing similar decisions.\u201d\n\nThat playbook appears to have been followed by the Cleveland Indians \u2014 who announced in December that the team\u2019s name would be dropped following the completion of a rebrand. The major difference in the approach is that Cleveland retained its Indians moniker rather than go by, say, the Cleveland Baseball Team. But the baseball club has mirrored many of the steps that Washington has taken \u2014 receiving thousands of submissions for new names and speaking with tens of thousands of people regarding what direction the team should take.\n\nIn June, the Indians said in a news release they have narrowed down the entries to a list of around 1,200 names. The Indians said they were moving on to begin the vetting process for legal purposes.\n\nWashington has done the same and appears ready to take the next step. A source familiar with the situation said the team is nearing the completion of its \u201cinsight phase\u201d \u2014 getting feedback on names and ideas \u2014 and will soon turn toward the creation phase. In other words, that\u2019s where the name, logo and other details will be sorted out.\n\nSnyder will be involved in the rebranding process, even as his wife, Tanya, takes temporary control of the day-to-day business operations as co-CEO, Wright said. The NFL announced Snyder would voluntarily take a step back for several months after the league fined the team $10 million following an investigation into sexual harassment allegations and other workplace misconduct.\n\n\u201cAs I have said before, they have given me the autonomy to make important changes and transform our business,\u201d Wright said.\n\nIf there\u2019s another impact that the last year has had on the portrayal of American Indian figures in sports, it\u2019s that the general public seems to be warming up to the cause. In May, Nielsen Fan Insights released a study that found 46% of respondents supported Washington and Cleveland rebranding. That stood in contrast to a Morning Consult poll from July 2020 that found only 29% of respondents believed that \u201cRedskins\u201d should no longer be used.\n\nFredericks, however, argued that public perception should matter less when it comes to discussing this matter. \u201cThese types of caricatures are not appropriate and hurtful\u201d to indigenous people, she said.\n\nThe push to get other teams using American Indian imagery to rebrand likely isn\u2019t over, either. The topic, for instance, came up again in January when the Braves faced calls to change their name to the \u201cHammers\u201d following the death of team legend \u201cHammerin\u2019\u201d Hank Aaron. Celebrities like actor Colin Hanks and former Braves MVP Dale Murphy supported the cause.\n\nLast summer, Braves chairman Terry McGuirk told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the team\u2019s expectation is \u201cwe will always be the Atlanta Braves.\u201d\n\nOf course, Snyder said essentially the same thing to USA Today in 2013. Seven years later, he relented.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity (for Washington) to be an example in how to change course on racism and how to do so in recognition in that racism has harmed,\u201d Fredericks said. \u201cConsidering the history, it was surprising they were the first ones to do this. It also presents an incredible opportunity for the team and the players, for the sponsors, to really be an example for others.\u201d",

            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Southeast Asia is a spectacularly beautiful place to visit\u2014just ask the 133 million tourists that vacationed in the region in 2019. While international travel may be off the table for the time being, there\u2019s no shortage of gorgeous destinations to dream about as we wait for tourism to become safe once again. For those seeking a quiet respite from busy city life, these pristine natural sites are perfect for your next trip to Southeast Asia\u2014however far off that may be.\n\nA true paradise for nature lovers, this iconic preserve is a Ramsar Wetland, UNESCO World Heritage Site, and New7Wonder of Nature all rolled into one. While the Filipino province of Palawan is no stranger to natural beauty, this park is especially renowned for its five-mile underground river, which serves as a popular day trip destination for locals and tourists alike. In addition to the subterranean waterway, the park is also home to massive old-growth forests that are rife with indigenous Filipino species, as well as towering limestone karsts, a striking geological feature that\u2019s formed through steady rainwater erosion.\n\nWhen it comes to tourism, Thailand\u2019s northeastern Isan region is more of a hidden gem, with Bangkok, Phuket, and Chiang Mai seeing the bulk of foreign visitors to the country. However, the spectacular beauty of the Red Lotus Lake gives these three destinations a run for their money. From December to February, this idyllic water feature springs to life with a massive bloom of vibrant pink flowers, serving as the perfect getaway to a region that\u2019s underappreciated by foreign visitors. Wildlife enthusiasts take note\u2014in addition to flowers, the lake is also packed with waterfowl and a wide variety of native fish to spot as well.\n\nLocated in the northern reaches of Borneo, this towering mountain is renowned for both its dizzying height and wealth of endemic species, two qualities that earned it a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage List in the year 2000. While the mountain and its verdant foothills are spectacular to view from afar, dedicated outdoor adventurers are welcome to test their limits with a hike to the mountain\u2019s summit. While there\u2019s no need for any carabiners or crampons, the 13,435-foot trek is no small feat\u2014visitors are required to stay with licensed guides for their entire journey.\n\nThe archipelago of Indonesia is home to over 17,000 individual islands, but there\u2019s something special about Komodo and its neighbors that set them apart from their fellow isles\u2014namely, ferocious reptiles found nowhere else in the wild. Commonly known as Komodo dragons, these infamous beasts are actually the world\u2019s largest type of lizard, and can measure in at up to ten feet in length. Of the four islands in the nation that harbor the creatures, Komodo is by far the most famous, with a wealth of boat tours and land excursions available for booking for those brave enough to seek out a dragon in the flesh.\n\nFor those wishing to immerse themselves in the stunning terraced hills that Vietnam is renowned for, few destinations can compare to L\u00e0o Cai Province, a hilly region in the northernmost reaches of the country. Opportunities abound for immersing oneself in both natural beauty and Vietnamese culture, with the city of L\u00e0o Cai, town of Sa Pa, and Vietnam\u2019s tallest mountain\u2014Phan Xi P\u0103ng\u2014all found within the province. For a truly memorable vacation, tourists can follow their visit with a trek across the Chinese border to Kunming, a verdant destination that\u2019s often called the \u201cCity of Eternal Spring\u201d.",

Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter.\n\n(CNN) US factories are feeling the squeeze of supply chain issues and materials shortages. As a result, manufacturers in June recorded the biggest price jump in 42 years.\n\nHere's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n\nThe House voted this week to create a select committee to investigate the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol -- and it's immediately become a politically fraught assignment. Republicans have made it clear they're not interested, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy even threatened to strip party members of other committee assignments if they accepted an offer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve. So far, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney has been tapped as one of the Democratic House speaker's committee picks. Cheney was previously removed from GOP House leadership after repeatedly criticizing ex-President Trump's false election claims. Meanwhile, new video from the insurrection is prompting more legal action against people who were there. The Justice Department this week rounded up several new defendants accused of destroying thousands of dollars' worth of professional broadcast equipment.\n\nRescue efforts at the Florida condo collapse site could face more challenges soon as a tropical storm approaches and risk of further collapse lingers . Work had to be halted for much of yesterday as engineers assessed the structure still standing. The rest of the building is expected to be demolished in coming weeks. Meanwhile, more ominous details from the years leading up to the collapse are coming to light. The building department in Surfside, Florida, was the target of mounting complaints by residents and contractors in late 2018 -- so much so that the town manager at the time placed the office under administrative review. A family suing the Champlain Towers South condo association also claims an engineering firm that performed a 2018 structural analysis on the building should have been more thorough\n\nThe Lower Kootenay Band, a member band of the Ktunaxa Nation, has announced the discovery of 182 human remains in unmarked graves at the site of another residential school in British Columbia. This site, near the city of Cranbrook, was formerly the St. Eugene's Mission School. This is the third boarding school where vast numbers of human remains have been identified. The discoveries have forced Canada to confront its history of systemic abuse of Indigenous communities, perpetuated in schools like these. The painful discoveries also led some Canadians to discourage celebrations during yesterday's Canada Day\n\nTHIS JUST IN ...\n\nAll US and coalition forces have left Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan\n\nWhat's safe to do over the 4th of July weekend?\n\nKrispy Kreme's second attempt on the public markets is much sweeter\n\nRichard Branson will try to beat Jeff Bezos to space\n\nVacation rental demand has gone crazy. Here's how you can still get a deal\n\nCelebrate the 4th of July by taking our quiz about American symbols!\n\nHere's one question to get you started: What is the national mammal of the United States?\n\n\"For many years the workplace environment at the Washington Football Team, both generally and particularly for women, was highly unprofessional.\"\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow",

            "description": "China declared officially malaria-free by WHO  CNN",
            "content": "Malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of a female mosquito, kills 400,000 people a year worldwide, the majority children younger than 5, according to WHO. There is no licensed malaria vaccine on the market -- though a number of vaccine candidates are under development, and one has shown unprecedented efficacy levels in trials this year.\n\nMalaria cases in China have been falling steeply since the turn of the century. In 2020, after reporting four consecutive years of zero indigenous cases, China applied for an official WHO certification of malaria elimination -- which was granted this week.\n\n\"Today we congratulate the people of China on ridding the country of malaria,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement on Wednesday . \"Their success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal.\"\n\nThere are 40 countries and territories worldwide that have been declared malaria-free. The only other Western Pacific countries with that accreditation are Australia, Singapore and Brunei, WHO said.\n\nMalaria had been a serious problem for China in the 1940s, with about 30 million cases reported annually. Authorities began working to stop the spread of malaria in the 1950s using preventative antimalarial medicines and measures to reduce mosquito breeding grounds. The problem was so severe that Communist troops fighting in the mosquito-ridden jungles of Vietnam were losing more soldiers to malaria than bullets. To find a solution, Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong launched a secret military campaign codenamed \"Project 523\" in 1967, during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. Scientist Tu Youyou was part of this secret project, and scoured ancient texts and folk manuals for clues, ultimately collecting 2,000 potential remedies. After whittling these down and testing each one on mice, she discovered a compound that reduced the number of malaria parasites in the rodents' blood -- a discovery that resulted in the drug artemisinin, humankind's best defense against the disease to date. In 2015, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine. These discoveries, along with the development of tools to prevent the disease like insecticide-treated nets, helped decrease the number of annual cases in China, which reached 117,000 by the end of 1990. The early 2000s saw additional funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, which allowed the country to step up its training, medicine and laboratory equipment. Within 10 years, cases had dropped to 5,000 per year. Bai Jinhua, the head of microbiology at Meng La County People's Hospital in China's Yunnan province, examines a blood smear for malaria parasites in April 2019. Scientists have continued making progress in research in recent few years; a population of the world's most invasive mosquito species, also the main source of bites and disease transmission, was almost completely wiped out by an experiment on two islands in the southern province of Guangdong, according to a 2019 study. Though China has been declared malaria-free, the disease could still return, WHO cautioned -- though it added that the country had a strong malaria surveillance and control program to prevent reestablishment of the disease. The southern Yunnan province is at especially high risk of imported cases, since it borders three countries with high rates of malaria: Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. China also has large diasporic and migrant worker communities in Africa, where malaria is endemic, raising the risk of the disease being brought back.",

            "content": "The union representing CUNY professors has passed a one-sided resolution rebuking Israel for recent attacks on Palestinians \u2014 adding that it may support the movement to boycott and divest from the Jewish state.\n\nThe Professional Staff Congress\u2019 resolution conspicuously omits any mention of Hamas launching rockets into residential areas of Israel during last month\u2019s confrontations between the warring sides.\n\nInstead, the resolution says, \u201cPSC-CUNY condemns the massacre of Palestinians by the Israeli state\u2019\u2019 \u2014 while decrying Israel\u2019s \u201cexpansionism and violent incursions into occupied territories.\u201d\n\nPSC-CUNY \u201ccannot be silent about the continued subjection of Palestinians to the state-supported displacement, occupation, and use of lethal force by Israel,\u2019\u2019 the missive says.\n\nIt adds that the Palestinian struggle for \u201cself determination\u201d is akin to the struggles of \u201cindigenous people and people of color in the United States\u201d and blacks in apartheid South Africa.\n\nThe statement drew outrage within and outside the City University of New York.\n\nJeff Wiesenfeld, who served as a CUNY governing-board trustee from 1999 to 2013, told The Post, \u201cI resolve to condemn the racist, anti-Semitic and academically useless PSC of CUNY, which serves only to poison the minds of future leaders inside and outside the classroom and thus further degrade a CUNY degree to its former state of complete devaluation.\u201d\n\nWiesenfeld said the union\u2019s statement ignores facts such as the Palestinian leadership rejecting land-for-peace deals with Israel and the Jewish state being surrounded by enemies and having a right to defend itself.\n\nLong Island GOP Congressman Lee Zeldin, who is running for governor, said in a statement posted on Twitter, \u201cThe City University of New York (CUNY) educators who just passed this insane pro-BDS resolution accusing Israel of a massacre of Palestinians, shouldn\u2019t have any ability at all to brainwash students, especially in a publicly funded university.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn College history Professor KC Johnson told The Post that the PSC doesn\u2019t speak for many teachers.\n\nJohnson called the resolution \u201csad and predictable\u201d and said the union is obsessed with \u201cfinding ways to condemn Israel\u201d while ignoring atrocities elsewhere.\n\nOne CUNY insider said that if one of the school system\u2019s students submitted such a resolution as a paper for a current events project, the work would deserve an F for being incomplete for excluding key material facts.\n\n\u201cIt make no mention that there were missiles launched from Gaza into Israel\u2019s towns and villages,\u2019\u2019 said the CUNY source, who requested anonymity, of PSC\u2019s resolution.\n\nThe resolution includes a line claiming that the PSC \u201ccondemns racism in all forms, including anti-Semitism\u201d \u2014 while contending that criticisms of the Jewish State of Israel \u201care not inherently anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nIt even blasted the US labor movement for \u201cfailing to challenge the U.S. government\u2019s support for Israeli expansionism and violent incursions in the occupied territories.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe PSC said that this fall, it will \u201cfacilitate discussions \u2026 and consider PSC support of the 2005 call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS).\u201d\n\nThe union described BDS as \u201ca movement launched by 170 Palestinian unions, refugee networks, women\u2019s organizations, professional associations and other Palestinian civil society organizations, which calls on people of conscience in the international community to act as they did against apartheid South Africa in the spirit of international solidarity, moral consistency and resistance to injustice and oppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Professional Staff Congress has a long history of both successfully fighting to improve the working conditions of our members and advocating within the labor movement against racism and for international solidarity,\u201d Davis said.\n\n\u201cWe are opposed to all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, and we condemn the displacement, occupation, and violence perpetrated by the Israeli state against Palestinians.\n\n\u201cThe resolution adopted by the delegates will facilitate discussion among our members of initiatives and campaigns that seek to influence the United States policy of support for Israel.\u201d",

            "description": "Portland commissioner who backs defunding police runs racial justice bureau with 'longstanding dysfunction'  Fox News",
            "content": "Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, who spearheaded the local defund police movement, is in hot water after attempting to block the public release of records about her \"equity\" bureau, which was found to be riddled with ethics and abuse of power issues permeating its bureaucratic ranks.\n\nHardesty was assigned in January as commissioner in charge of the Office of Community & Civic Life, which handles a range of responsibilities in Portland\u2019s city government, including handling cannabis tax refunds and a \"racial equity plan\" with \"social justice goals\" aimed at addressing \"systemic racism\" and encouraging development within Black, indigenous, people of color, immigrant, and refugee communities, its website reads.\n\nLast year, the Portland Bureau of Human Resources and city ombudsman Margie Sollinger both received a mass of complaints from Civic Life employees. The City Attorney's Office then contracted the consulting firm ASCETA to conduct a review into the department and provide recommendations on work culture.\n\nThe 65-page review made public last week found \"longstanding dysfunction\" passed down from previous management that has festered and developed untreated into systemic distrust. Leadership and management style were described as \"hierarchical\" and \"punitive\" in the review, which was based on interviews with about two-thirds of current Civic Life employees and a dozen former employees.\n\nWork culture involved \"toxicity\" and mass firings were common. The review found \"unquestioning loyalty is seen as rewarded and there is a perception of favoritism in management and hiring practices,\" while \"questioning and criticism is felt to be discouraged and in some cases, felt punished harshly.\"\n\nFilings said that the complaints came from \"Caucasians and people of color, employees with long seniority as well as relatively new employees, line employees and supervisory employees.\"\n\nThe report also said the \"kitchen sink bureau\" often lacked clarity in its scope of work and ambiguity ensured uncertainty. Employees described having a fear of retaliation and experienced psychological trauma from working in the department, according to the review obtained by the Portland Tribune.\n\nHardesty has been an early advocate of defunding police in Portland since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis nearly a year ago. Earlier this month, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and city council greenlighted a $3,000,000 cut to the Portland Police Bureau. According to the city\u2019s police union, Portland has defunded its police department by approximately $30 million since June of last year.\n\nAfter the review was finalized in March, the City Attorney\u2019s Office denied several public records requests from parties, including the Tribune, who had sought its release, citing attorney-client privilege. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt rejected that argument and ruled it public record on May 11. The bureau\u2019s director, Suk Rhee, resigned on May 14. And the review ultimately recommended she and three other managers be replaced.\n\nHours before its expected release, Hardesty issued a statement saying her office conducted meetings with current and past employees, neighborhood associations, district coalitions and others since being assigned Civic Life in January and is \"best able to help lead this bureau out of turmoil.\"\n\n\"To do this, it is necessary that as a leader I am able to build trust \u2014 both with our community and employees,\" the statement said. \"I believe that I will achieve this by rebuilding a bureau more streamlined for the work ahead and investing in building a leadership team that reflects the city's core values; I look forward to the work ahead.\"\n\nOmbudsman Sollinger and others have criticized Hardesty for allegedly withholding the review, accusing her of lacking the transparency needed in fixing the bureau\u2019s issues. But Hardesty said she still disagreed with the District Attorney's decision in making its findings public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This assessment is not an audit or performance evaluation of any individual and was intended to provide attorney client privileged information on personnel matters,\" Hardesty continued. \"Although I value the need for transparency in public spending and operations, and always intended to make available a public summary report, I am disappointed in the District Attorney's ruling as this makes publicly available what were intended to be confidential recommendations.\"",

            "content": "According to The Washington Post, it's hunting season for cancel culture and its latest targets are \"racist\" birds.\n\nThe Post ran an expansive report on Thursday, titled \"The racist legacy many birds carry,\" focused on the \"birding community,\" which apparently is having a difficult debate \"about the names of species connected to enslavers, supremacists and grave robbers.\"\n\n\"Corina Newsome is a Black ornithologist, as rare as some of the birds she studies,\" Post environmental justice reporter Darryl Fears began his piece, noting she was hired to \"break down barriers\" at the Georgia Audubon nature preserve.\n\n\"But overcoming those barriers will be daunting. As with the wider field of conservation, racism and colonialism are in ornithology\u2019s DNA, indelibly linked to its origin story. The challenge of how to move forward is roiling White ornithologists as they debate whether to change as many as 150 eponyms, names of birds that honor people with connections to slavery and supremacy.\"\n\nFears wrote that birds such as Bachman\u2019s sparrow and Wallace\u2019s fruit dove \"bear the names of men who fought for the Southern cause, stole skulls from Indian graves for pseudoscientific studies that were later debunked, and bought and sold Black people.\"\n\nSix different species of birds are named after British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, who \"frequently used the n-word\" in his writings, The Post reported. And three birds are named after James Sligo Jameson, another British naturalist who was \"involved in a heinous act committed against a young girl he purchased as \u2018a joke\u2019\" and \"drew sketches of the child being stabbed and dismembered.\"\n\n\"Conservation has been driven by white patriarchy, this whole idea of calling something a wilderness after you move people off it or exterminate them and that you get to take ownership,\" Black ornithologist J. Drew Lanham told the newspaper.\n\n\"They are a reminder that this field that I work in was primarily developed and shaped by people not like me, who probably would have viewed me as lesser,\" Asian American ornithologist Olivia Wang similarly expressed. \"They are also a reminder of how Western ornithology, and natural exploration in general, was often tied to a colonialist mind-set of conquering and exploiting and claiming ownership of things rather than learning from the humans who were already part of the ecosystem and had been living alongside these birds for lifetimes.\"\n\nThe report points out that the National Audubon Society itself is problematic since it is named after famed ornithologist John James Audubon, a slave owner who has been dead for 170 years.\n\n\"I am deeply troubled by the racist actions of John James Audubon and recognize how painful that legacy is for Black, Indigenous and people of color who are part of our staff, volunteers, donors and members,\" Elizabeth Gray of the National Audubon Society told The Post. \"Although we have begun to address this part of our history, we have a lot more to unpack.\"\n\nNewsome was troubled when she first wore a work shirt that featured Audubon's name, Fears writing that her \"pain is real.\"\n\n\"I felt like I was wearing the name of an oppressor, the name of someone who enslaved my ancestors, Newsome said. \"I believe they should both absolutely change the name. It feels wrong to enter African American communities \u2026 celebrating [Audubon\u2019s] name. It\u2019s a reality I am wrestling with constantly.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile efforts to rename such birds and the National Audubon Society had faced resistance, there was apparently a paradigm shift following the viral Central Park incident in 2020, when a White woman called 911 on a Black birdwatcher she dubiously accused of threatening her and her dog.\n\n\"Within days of the incident in Central Park last year, Newsome helped organize a very public declaration dubbed Black Birders Week \u2014 an event that quickly became a viral movement,\" Fears reported. \"By happenstance, it took place amid nationwide demonstrations and calls for racial justice following George Floyd\u2019s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.\"",

            "title": "America Needs to Break Up Its Biggest States",
            "description": "America Needs to Break Up Its Biggest States  The New York Times",
            "content": "The solution has clear precedent in American history: break up the largest states, ideally into components with populations as close to the state median as possible. Kentucky was created out of territory that originally belonged to Virginia, as was Tennessee from North Carolina territory and Maine from the territory of Massachusetts. No constitutional amendment would be required; per the terms of Article IV, creating states from a state that already exists would merely require the state legislature to vote to split up and for Congress to assent. And unlike consolidating smaller states, which would reduce their citizens\u2019 representation, splitting up the large states would increase it, giving their voters a reason to be supportive.\n\nCongress could help structure the process by setting a minimum size for new states (say, one-half the population of the median state, about 2.25 million) and requiring them to have territorial integrity and avoid partisan gerrymandering, all of which would help assure that the break up improved national governance. But carving the four megastates into three or more states each might have a host of benefits for their internal governance as well.\n\nFor example, New York City currently lacks many powers that are crucial to management, like full control of its transportation system. If, as part of a larger national reorganization, New York City were to become a city-state \u2014 as Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen are in Germany \u2014 it could assume most of those powers, while its senators in Washington could focus on a national agenda relevant to urban America. Inasmuch as New York City needs partners to coordinate with, the most important ones are in New Jersey and Connecticut, not in Buffalo and Rochester \u2014 so splitting up New York State could add momentum to proposals for regional governance across state lines. Meanwhile, upstate New York would have a better chance at pursuing its own development in ways that suit its commonality with other Rust Belt regions without being captive to the needs and preferences of a city with which it has had little in common economically since the near obsolescence of the Erie Canal.\n\nSimilarly, splitting California into at least three states \u2014 as has been proposed before, most recently in a failed ballot initiative \u2014 would allow its very different regions to pursue policies appropriate to their character and interests. California could even plausibly be broken into as many as five states, if the Bay Area and Los Angeles were hived off to become city-states, which they are certainly populous enough to be.\n\nSplitting up the largest states would not necessarily favor Democrats or Republicans \u2014 which is another reason it might be a good idea and why Congress might want to condition approval of one state breakup on others, much as Maine and Missouri were admitted in 1820 and 1821 to preserve the national balance between free and slave states. New York City would undoubtedly be a safe Democratic state \u2014 but upstate New York might well be as competitive between the parties as Pennsylvania is today. A state carved out of northern Florida would likely be reliably Republican, but the central region would probably be purple, while southern Florida would have a Democratic lean. Carving up Texas, meanwhile, would open up opportunities for Democrats but could also lower the temperature on the possibility of the state\u2019s flipping blue by giving residents of Lubbock and Midland an escape route to a safely red republic.\n\nThere will be sentimental objections to these suggestions as well as practical ones \u2014 how could we even consider breaking up the Empire State? But sentiment about the past should not obscure the possibilities of creation. How often does a political community get a chance to choose a new name for itself, a new flag to fly? We shouldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to refound political communities on a new and more inclusive basis.\n\nThe states that exist today, even when they were given names with Indigenous sources, were founded and organized overwhelmingly by white settlers. So it could be powerfully symbolic if, for example, members of the Seneca, Oneida, Mohawk and other nations of the old Iroquois Confederacy played a central public role in defining a state covering their old territory.",

And unlike consolidating smaller states, which would reduce their citizens\u2019 representation, splitting up the large states would increase it, giving their voters a reason to be supportive. \n\nCongress could help structure the process by setting a minimum size for new states (say, one-half the population of the median state, about 2.25 million) and requiring them to have territorial integrity and avoid partisan gerrymandering, all of which would help assure that the break up improved national governance. Inasmuch as New York City needs partners to coordinate with, the most important ones are in New Jersey and Connecticut, not in Buffalo and Rochester \u2014 so splitting up New York State could add momentum to proposals for regional governance across state lines.",

            "content": "Naomi Osaka celebrated a point during her opening match win against Zheng Saisai of China at the Summer Olympics.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAfter the tumult over her skipping the French Open and Wimbledon, she returned to light the cauldron for what may very well end up as the Osaka Games.\n\nTOKYO \u2014 In the early afternoon Sunday, Naomi Osaka walked onto the center court at the Ariake Tennis Park to begin her quest for an Olympic gold medal. She was supposed to play on Saturday, but the match happened to be delayed hours after she stood atop a pyramid built in the shape of Mount Fuji and lit the Olympic cauldron. Once again, it seemed the sports world was bending in the direction of one of the best tennis players in the game. It was quite the turn for Osaka, who just seven weeks ago was enduring the first true crisis of her career.\n\nShe caused upheaval in the tennis world, and intensified the discussion around athletes and mental health, when she withdrew from the French Open and skipped Wimbledon as well after refusing to endure what she called the stress of mandatory news conferences at Grand Slam tournaments. For a while, the Olympics hung in the balance until she committed to them, unable to pass up representing Japan on home turf. Then on Friday night, there she was, joining a very short list of Olympic flame lighters that includes Muhammad Ali, Wayne Gretzky, Rafer Johnson and Cathy Freeman, the Australian runner and a singular figure of Indigenous people. \u201cI feel a little bit out of my body right now,\u201d Osaka said on Sunday, minutes after winning her first-round match in the Olympic tennis competition, a rare 87 minutes of normalcy.\n\nThe ultimate Olympic moment seemed fitting for Osaka, a child of a Haitian father and a Japanese mother, who was born in Japan but largely raised in the United States. She chose the country of her birth as her lone nationality in 2019. Players speak of tennis as both a sport and a means of self-expression, and Osaka has climbed the ranks with a style of reflecting the way she seems to live. Her presence quietly fills the court, and she dominates with bursts of power \u2014 sudden, unreturnable forehands from six feet behind the baseline, jumping backhands, aces boomed down the T. Waiting to return her opponent\u2019s serve, she often makes a fist with her left hand and whacks herself on the thigh two or three times to fire herself up. Those she has vanquished include Serena Williams in an upset at the U.S. Open final in 2018, which, in retrospect, was a torch-passing moment. Then Osaka picked up another Grand Slam event title a few months later at the 2019 Australian Open. And yet, as recently as 13 months ago, despite the growing fame that had already made her the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete, Osaka could still slip into a march in Minneapolis largely unnoticed with thousands of others to protest police violence against Black people. Her activism intensified after Jacob Blake was shot in the back after exchanging words with the police in Kenosha, Wis.\n\nWithin hours, the United States Tennis Association announced that it would halt play for a day, a remarkable move she had inspired. At the U.S. Open the next week, she showed up with seven masks, each with the name of a victim of police violence. She said she would wear one before each match. She had seven, because she intended to play in the final. She did, and she won it. This year has already produced another Grand Slam event title, but also the crisis of the French Open. After the tumult, Osaka said little. She gave no interviews, and yet hardly lacked for a media presence. She wrote an essay on mental health for Time, and appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.",

Then on Friday night, there she was, joining a very short list of Olympic flame lighters that includes Muhammad Ali, Wayne Gretzky, Rafer Johnson and Cathy Freeman, the Australian runner and a singular figure of Indigenous people. Then Osaka picked up another Grand Slam event title a few months later at the 2019 Australian Open. And yet, as recently as 13 months ago, despite the growing fame that had already made her the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete, Osaka could still slip into a march in Minneapolis largely unnoticed with thousands of others to protest police violence against Black people.",

            "content": "A New Jersey school district has voted to eliminate \u201cthe names of all religious and secular holidays from the school calendar \u2026 opting for the more generic description \u2018Day Off.\u2019\u201d You can guess the reason. They used those increasingly popular words \u2014 \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cequitable.\u201d\n\nNo more Christmas, Hanukkah, Memorial Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, or even Indigenous Peoples Day (formerly known as Columbus Day). Maybe they should keep April Fools\u2019 Day because that accurately reflects their decision. Or, since they have chosen \u201cDay Off,\u201d they could name them after the film character Ferris Bueller.\n\nNew Jersey State Sen. Anthony M. Bucco tells me: \u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where it\u2019s becoming acceptable to sanitize American history and our shared, diverse culture to please a small politically correct minority. Americans should stand up to this nonsense when it comes to their communities and fight back.\u201d\n\nIn Fairfax County, Virginia, the country\u2019s 10th largest school district, school board member Abrar Omeish was invited to deliver the commencement address to Justice High School, formerly known as J.E.B. Stuart High School. The name was changed as part of the continuing effort to eradicate anything related to slavery and the Confederacy. J.E.B. Stuart was an officer in the Confederate Army.\n\nMs. Omeish was a co-chair of Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign in Virginia. She is also a spokeswoman for the group \u201cNo Muslim Ban Ever.\u201d\n\nBefore her speech, RedState.com reports, a student recited the Pledge of Allegiance, but not the one we are used to: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under Allah, indivisible, and with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nMs. Omeish said the U.S. was guilty of stealing land from Native Americans. She also denounced \u201cextreme capitalism, individualism and white supremacy.\u201d She has previously made remarks The Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington has said \u201ctarget and marginalize Jewish students and their families.\u201d\n\nThese and other incidents and decisions made by school boards across the country have raised the ire of many parents. Some have shown up at public board meetings, denouncing members. Others are engaged in recall efforts. The question is whether any of their replacements will be better than the current ones and would they also give in to pressure from various groups that want to \u201cfundamentally transform America,\u201d as former President Obama pledged to do?\n\nThis summer offers a unique opportunity for parents and their children. After more than a year of distance learning that has left some students behind, especially those in marginalized communities, now is an excellent time to rethink our entire education system. Public education, established three centuries ago with values that are in sharp contrast to what is taught today, has long exceeded its expiration date.\n\nParents should take advantage of school choice in states that allow them to choose the schools \u2014 public, private, religious, or home school \u2014 which best teach subjects that matter and at a minimum do not undermine the country, its history (good and bad), their faith and societal values.\n\nThe pandemic has allowed many parents to see the contrast between what many public schools have become \u2014 \u201cmissionaries\u201d for a far-left and secular agenda \u2014 and what they were taught as students in an altogether different country.\n\nWhatever school board changes might occur, parents have it in their hands to make a lasting difference by depriving the system of raw material \u2014 their children \u2014 who in many cases are being indoctrinated with secular progressive ideas. President Biden wants to begin molding young minds even earlier. He has proposed free pre-K classes.\n\nAn admonition by the late first lady Barbara Bush seems even more important today: \u201cYour success as a family \u2026 our success as a nation \u2026 depends not on what happens inside the White House, but on what happens inside your house.\u201d\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (Harper Collins/Zondervan, January 2020).",

            "content": "\n\u2022 Biden says efforts to restrict voting access is \u2018most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War'\n\u2022 Biden's remarks come as at least 14 states have enacted laws restricting voting access.\n\u2022 Biden has said protecting voting rights will be a priority for his administration.\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2013 In what he described as the \"most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War,\" President Joe Biden in Philadelphia on Tuesday warned Americans that there is an \"assault\" on democracy and urged them to fight efforts in Republican-led states to pass laws that restrict voting access.\n\n\"Hear me clearly. There's an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are as Americans,\" Biden said during his speech at the National Constitution Center to roughly 300 people.\n\n\"The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real,\" he said. \"It's unrelenting.\"\n\nBiden called on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, saying it's a \"national imperative.\"\n\n\"We'll be asking my Republican friends in Congress and states and cities and counties to stand up for God's sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our election and the sacred right to vote,\" Biden said. \"Have you no shame?\"\n\n\u2018This is not a great outcome\u2019: Supreme Court ruling brings fear of explosion in voting restrictions\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks come as at least 14 states have enacted laws that restrict voting access following last year\u2019s presidential election and as former President Donald Trumpcontinues to spread baseless claims that his loss to Biden was the result of widespread voter fraud.\n\nBiden's speech also came as more than 50 Texas House Democrats made their way to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to stop a vote on restrictive election laws in their state. Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with the group of Democrats this week.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where Biden eked out a narrow victory over Trump, Republican state Rep. Doug Mastriano, a Trump ally, is trying to launch a review of the state\u2019s presidential election results similar to what is underway in Arizona.\n\nTrump in a statement criticized Biden's trip to Philadelphia. Trump said Biden went to Pennsylvania in \"order to stop the Forensic Audit that the Pennsylvania Republican Senate is in the process of doing.\"\n\n'The Big Lie is just that, a big lie'\n\nDuring his speech, Biden recalled the multiple failed legal challenges and recounts during the 2020 election. He added that \"no other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such standards.\"\n\n\"The Big Lie is just that, a big lie,\" Biden said of those challenging the results of the election.\n\nIn Congress, sweeping legislation that Democrats argue would make it easier for people to vote and register to vote has stalled in the Senate as a result of a Republican filibuster. And earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arizona law that limits how absentee ballots may be returned, a ruling that critics asserted would make it more difficult for minorities to challenge laws they believe are discriminatory.\n\nBiden has said that voting rights will be a priority for his administration and has tasked Harris with leading the administration\u2019s efforts to protect ballot access.\n\nLast week, Harris announced a $25 million expansion of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cI Will Vote\u201d initiative to bolster voter education and protection, targeted voter registration and deployment of new technology to increase access.\n\nWhile Biden's speech Tuesday received praise from some activists, they also urged the president and vice president to do everything in their power \u2013 even making changes to the filibuster \u2013 to have Congress pass the bills that will protect voters.\n\n\u201cThis existential crisis of democracy requires urgent action as some erect deliberate barriers to the ballot box for Black, brown, Indigenous, and new Americans,\" said Wade Henderson, interim president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"The president and vice president must do everything possible to ensure legislation like the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act become law, even if that means supporting the change of archaic Senate rules to protect our freedom to vote.\u201d",

            "description": "How Islamic design shaped Europe's Gothic architecture  Los Angeles Times",
            "content": "I\u2019ve been studying up on the first episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d because it\u2019s important to know our culture\u2019s origin stories. I\u2019m Carolina A. Miranda, arts and urban design columnist for the Los Angeles Times, and now that I\u2019ve delivered that critical Kardashians update (with many thanks to my colleague Yvonne Villarreal) it\u2019s time to move on to the artsy fartsies:\n\nOn April 16, 2019, a day after the Notre Dame Cathedral had been engulfed by flames in Paris, Middle East scholar Diana Darke noted on Twitter that the great icon of French nationhood was in fact inspired by Syrian architecture. \u201cNotre-Dame\u2019s architectural design, like all Gothic cathedrals in Europe, comes directly from #Syria\u2019s Qalb Lozeh 5th century church,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCrusaders brought the \u2018twin tower flanking the rose window\u2019 concept back to Europe in the 12th century.\u201d\n\nShe followed the tweet up with a blog post titled \u201cThe heritage of Notre Dame \u2014 less European than people think.\u201d The article went more in depth on Qalb Lozeh (which means \u201cHeart of the Almond\u201d in Arabic). She also noted that some of the design elements prevalent in Gothic architecture can trace their origins to the buildings of the Umayyad dynasty, a Damascus-based caliphate whose descendants later ruled Moorish Spain. (Known as the first great Muslim dynasty, their rule began in the 7th century.)\n\nDarke has expanded that fascinating post (which garnered international media attention) into an equally fascinating book, \u201cStealing From the Saracens: How Islamic Architecture Shaped Europe,\u201d which was released by Oxford University Press in the United States last November.\n\nAnd it is revelatory.\n\nIn it, she charts the influence of structures such as the 7th century Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, also known as the Dome of the Rock (and recently the site of crackdowns against Palestinian protesters by the Israeli military). Some European crusaders mistook Al Aqsa as the biblical Temple of Solomon, looking to it for inspiration in their own religious architecture.\n\nAmong the influences derived from Islamic design was the pointed arch. While not specifically a Muslim innovation (isolated examples existed in locations around Persia and Syria prior to the advent of Islam), its use was spread far and wide via Muslim religious shrines such as Al Aqsa. There are practical reasons for its spread, too. A pointed arch is stronger than the rounded Roman arch, therefore allowing for the construction of taller buildings.\n\nThese innovations came partly from advancements in mathematics during the Islamic Golden Age (which ran from about the 8th to the 13th century). As Darke writes, it was a scholar of Turkic origin, Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-846), \u201cwhose name was Latinised as Algoritmi, from which we get the Western word \u2018algorithm.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe book details countless other points of influence that emerged out of Middle Eastern and Islamic architecture and centuries later became design staples in Europe. Among them: the rose window, the trefoil arch, as well as sophisticated dome construction and stained glass fabrication techniques \u2014 not to mention the minaret, which was likely repurposed as a bell tower by Christians.\n\nDarke tracks how some of these influences were absorbed into European design \u2014 via returning Crusaders, roving guilds of masons, Islamic rule in Spain and through cosmopolitan sites of trade such as Venice, where lacy constructions bear the imprint of Middle Eastern influence.\n\nIn one particularly startling juxtaposition, she shows the architectural similarities between London\u2019s iconic Big Ben and the minaret from the Great Mosque of Aleppo in Syria (an Umayyad building). Both are squared off towers that rise in four sections, and both are decorated with similar elements, such as trefoil arches. (The minaret, sadly, collapsed during clashes in Syria\u2019s civil war in 2013).\n\nA particularly exciting episode (Hollywood, please take note) details the treacherous odyssey made by the 20-year-old Abd Al-Rahman, grandson of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham, to Spain in the 8th century. It was a cinematic escape from political opponents that led to the establishment of eight centuries of Islamic rule in Spain.\n\nThough dense in parts, \u201cStealing From the Saracens\u201d ultimately reveals the countless ways in which Western culture has been shaped by Islamic thought \u2014 including here in the United States. (Gothic architecture has inspired plenty of religious and academic architecture all over the U.S. Just look at all the pale facsimiles of the style currently planted all over campus at USC.)\n\nAnd in that regard, Darke\u2019s book serves a vital purpose. \u201cAre we ready, in the current climate of Islamophobia,\u201d she writes in the introduction, \u201cto acknowledge that a style so closely identified with European Christian identity owes its origins to Islamic architecture?\u201d\n\nDarke is unsure of the answer to question. But her eye-opening book is a solid first step.\n\nFor the price of a McMansion in Brentwood, writes classical music critic Mark Swed, Inglewood got itself a new concert hall. Well, not entirely new. The Beckmen YOLA Center occupies what was once a dilapidated bank building on South La Brea Avenue, which has now been reconfigured by Frank Gehry and his team into a new practice and performance space for the LA Phil\u2019s Youth Orchestra Los Angeles. The hall isn\u2019t open yet. But Swed got in for an early sound check.\n\nIn other Gehry-related news: Philly Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron has a look at his firm\u2019s redo of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a renovation project that has been 15 years in the making. It\u2019s a design that defers to the building\u2019s original design, executed in the 1920s by a collaborative team that included Horace Trumbauer, Julian Abele, Paul Cret, C. Clark Zantzinger and Charles Borie Jr. \u201cInstead of wreaking havoc,\u201d writes Saffron, \u201cthe 92-year-old architectural radical has played against type and given museum officials precisely what they wanted: clarity, light, and space.\u201d\n\nAnd the Venice Architecture Biennale has opened its doors in Italy. The show was already in the works when the pandemic hit, but it nonetheless was set to address global issues such as climate change, mass migration and inequity. \u201cThe pandemic will hopefully go away,\u201d curator Hashim Sarkis told the New York Times. \u201cBut unless we address these causes, we will not be able to move forward.\u201d\n\nCulture reporter Ashley Lee talked with filmmaker Jon M. Chu about the making of the cinematic version of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Broadway musical \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and the ways in which he was inspired, early on in his career, by movie musicals. \u201cThere\u2019s a truthfulness of why music and dance exist in these stories in the first place,\u201d Chu tells Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s not because a melody is catchy but because just saying the words isn\u2019t sufficient to communicate whatever that character wants to express.\u201d\n\nJessica Gelt writes about the Geffen Playhouse\u2018s new virtual musical for kids, \u201cThe Door You Never Saw Before.\u201d The show, whose themes explore the isolation of the pandemic, literally brought her to tears. \u201cAlong the way, children choose which door to open or not open, and whether to visit the overpass or underpass, the lost and found or the library,\u201d she writes. The actors play \u201ca variety of characters whose songs gently tap into deep emotions children may have dealt with during an isolating year.\u201d\n\nAs the USC Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena reopens, it will be with a new lens on the collections, reports Times contributor Scarlet Cheng. This includes a reevaluation of the nature of the objects (such as those that exoticize Asian cultures), as well as their provenance. Plus, the museum is looking to integrate more contemporary artists into the program. \u201cThe Asian experience and the Asian American experience is so flattened by the way we typically talk about it,\u201d says curator Rebecca Hall. \u201cAs a curator, I know artists can fill that out in a rich way.\u201d\n\nA frequent trope about Los Angeles is that it is not a philanthropic city (one repeated in a recent story in the New York Times). Well, I looked into the numbers and found that the assertion simply isn\u2019t grounded in fact. Not only does L.A. score above average on giving, it is several notches ahead of New York. But, ultimately, megadonor philanthropy is not something a city\u2019s art scene should rest on. As I argue this week, it\u2019s time to \u201cretire the outmoded idea that the most important factor in a city\u2019s cultural landscape is the presence of some white knight bearing a checkbook.\u201d\n\nWhich reminds me, D.J. Waldie published this excellent assessment of Eli Broad\u2018s legacy early last month: \u201cOften the buildings he fretted over reflect Broad\u2019s image more than the city\u2019s, particularly the cheerless museum he named for himself.\u201d\n\nThis week, the L.A. City Council voted to approve historic-cultural monument status for the building that once harbored the studio of Corita Kent, who made a name for herself in the 1960s as the \u201cPop Art Nun,\u201d producing work that pushed the boundaries of convention. I write about why the designation is a big deal: It\u2019s a rare case of a solo female visual artist being honored in the city\u2019s landscape.\n\nPlus, the Huntington Library has acquired a cache of images that depict daily life in L.A.'s old Chinatown.\n\nSort of related: the National Trust for Historic Preservation has issued its yearly list of the 11 most endangered historic places. Among them, the Trujillo Adobe in Riverside and Summit Tunnels 6 and 7 and the Summit Camp Site in Truckee, important Transcontinental Railroad links built by Chinese railroad labor.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra on June 26 will be the first group to take the stage at Walt Disney Concert Hall since it was shuttered by the pandemic more than a year ago. Among the invited guests will be 200 winners of a ticket giveaway (for those who are fully vaccinated). Plus, there will be plenty of rules governing everything from staging to audience seating. \u201cIt\u2019s been an exercise in organizational agility and fluidity,\u201d Executive Director Ben Cadwallader tells The Times\u2019 Deborah Vankin.\n\nThe Music Center has also returned from its somnolent state with its outdoor Dance at Dusk shows. Jessica Gelt attended a tap extravaganza featuring a performance by queen of tap Dormeshia. The show, she writes, awakened \u201cL.A.'s cultural nerve center.\u201d\n\nA survey sponsored by the American Alliance of Museums shows that damage from the pandemic may not be as severe as originally anticipated. Last year, it was reported that nearly a third of U.S. museums might permanently shut down as a result of COVID-19. That number has now been revised to 15%.\n\nAs LGBTQ Pride Month kicks off, The Times\u2019 Matt Cooper rounds up the best things to do, including an outdoor exhibit organized by the ONE Archives Foundation and a virtual benefit featuring performances by Lil Nas X, Dolly Parton and Ricky Martin.\n\nThe Natural History Museum has created a worthwhile online exhibition component for Barbara Carrasco\u2018s portable mural, \u201cL.A. History: A Mexican Perspective,\u201d which it recently acquired. This includes the ability to zoom in on key details and read background on the histories and historical objects that shaped the work.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to see something IRL, make time for \u201cWhen I Remember I See Red: American Indian Art and Activism in California\u201d at the Autry Museum of the American West. This group exhibition captures a period in which increased Indigenous activism over issues related to civil rights and federal termination policies (which sought to put an end tribal autonomy) brought together Indigenous communities from around the country in potent ways.\n\nThe show includes some stunning paintings by Tony Abeyta, Dalbert Castro, Frank LaPena and Rick Bartow, as well as a set of wry sculptures by Mooshka (born Kevin Cata) that riff on kink and kachinas. Also in the show: the logbook employed during the Indigenous occupation of Alcatraz in the 1960s and \u201870s, described by one scholar as that protest\u2019s \u201choly grail.\u201d (I wrote about it late last year.)\n\n\u201cWhen I Remember I See Red\u201d is on view at the Autry through Nov. 14, autry.org.\n\nRaimund Hoghe, a German dancer and choreographer who served as a dramaturge to Pina Bausch and later incorporated his physical disabilities into his work, has died at 72.\n\nChi Modu, a photographer who helped chronicle rap\u2019s ascendancy, making portraits of figures such as Eazy-E, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., is dead at 54.\n\nSophie Rivera, a photographer known for her elegant portraits of Puerto Rican New Yorkers and other inhabitants of the city, is dead at 82.\n\nJay Belloli, an independent Los Angeles curator who was intrigued by the ways in which art intersected with space (the galactic kind), and who served as interim director of the Pasadena Museum of California Art from 2016 to 2017, has died at 76.\n\n\u2014 A report that is equal parts chilling and enlightening on how robots are being used to mitigate isolation among the elderly.\n\n\u2014 How a group of dancers confronted state violence in Colombia with some well-timed vogueing. A remarkable piece about dance as resistance.\n\n\u2014 Urban design often overlooks the needs of teenage girls, writes critic Alexandra Lange. A new movement is trying to change that.\n\n\u2014 Some execs at L.A. Metro want to keep widening freeways, despite what the residents around those freeways or the EPA have to say about it. \n\n\u2014 The Mexican government sent troops to seize land next to the ruins of Teotihuac\u00e1n, where authorities have reported that bulldozers were wrecking part of the outlying parts of the ancient city.\n\n\u2014 Good recycling: A New York City art project repurposed plywood that was used to shutter storefronts during last year\u2019s protests.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Hiroshima Panels,\u201d a series of famous paintings made by Iri and Toshi Maruki in reaction to the atomic bombing of Japan, are set to receive needed conservation work for the very first time. (Contributor Jeff Spurrier wrote about these singular works for The Times last summer.)\n\n\u2014 John Yau digs into the mysteries of Jasper Johns\u2019 \u201cGreen Angel\u201d motif.\n\n\u2014 Jillian Steinhauer on the art world\u2019s fetish of \u201crediscovering\u201d old women artists.\n\n\u2014 In Wisconsin, Mary Louise Schumacher reports on Art Preserve, a unique exhibition site that marries an art museum with an art storage facility for unique works by folk and self-taught artists. Highly intriguing!\n\n\u2014 Emily Colucci is not having the wall text for the Alice Neel show at the Met.\n\nAnd last but not least ...\n\nI\u2019ve really been enjoying the poetry of \u201cLost Notes,\u201d culture critic Hanif Abdurraqib\u2019s music history podcast for KCRW.",

            "description": "Newsom needs to extend the California eviction moratorium  Los Angeles Times",
            "content": "For the length of the pandemic, the fear of an eviction tsunami and crushing rent debt has loomed over struggling tenants. With California\u2019s eviction moratorium set to expire in a little over a week, how Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders manage the end of pandemic tenant protections and the distribution of federal rent relief will be a test of their commitment to an equitable recovery.\n\nDone well, California could create a strong safety net that ensures vulnerable tenants are protected from losing their homes or suffering lasting financial harm. Done poorly, the state could exacerbate existing disparities and worsen the crisis of homelessness and housing instability. The choice should be clear: California should leave no tenant behind.\n\nThe good news is that lawmakers are very likely to extend the eviction moratorium to allow more time for tenants and landlords to receive federal funding that will clear rent debt and avoid the threat of eviction. That makes sense.\n\nLike many states, California has been abysmally slow in doling out the billions of dollars Congress allocated to help tenants cover unpaid rent. Just over 2% of people who have applied for rent relief have received the money, according a recent report. It would be a travesty if California allowed evictions to resume while sitting on pandemic rental assistance funds. Given the tremendous upheaval and the long-term repercussions of an eviction for tenants, it\u2019s only fair to extend the moratorium a bit longer so the state can get the money to landlords.\n\nBut the eviction moratorium is just one piece of the puzzle. Several changes are needed to the state\u2019s existing rent relief program to ensure that vulnerable tenants aren\u2019t excluded from receiving much-needed aid.\n\nThe state divvied up the first round of federal relief dollars by population rather than need. That will benefit some communities and leave others behind. For example, in cities with more homeowners, higher incomes or low rents, the federal money could be enough to pay all rent and utility debt for qualified tenants and provide rental assistance for several months into the future.\n\nBut in high-need areas, like Los Angeles, with high rents and a large population of low-income tenants, the money will not stretch as far. In fact, projections show that under the current funding formula, L.A. will run out of rent relief early, leaving no financial assistance for 43% of renter households who have filed applications.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders have to fix the funding formula. It\u2019s unfair and cruel to leave some tenants in debt or facing eviction simply because they live in a community that has more needs than funding. And we know who will be hurt the most by the shortfall: the groups that have been hardest hit by the pandemic economic fallout, including low-wage workers and single parents in Black, Latino and Indigenous households. If California leaders are serious about closing the state\u2019s equity gap, then they have to ensure that communities with the greatest need get the rent relief they need.\n\nThere\u2019s another problem: The financial assistance doesn\u2019t cover the other kinds of debt that low-income tenants racked up during the pandemic so that they could keep paying their rent. Many paid their rent with credit cards, personal borrowing or payday loans. They don\u2019t currently qualify for help but they still have crushing obligations that could damage their credit, making it harder to find a home or get a job in the future. These folks shouldn\u2019t be penalized or cut out of the relief program.\n\nLastly, landlords cannot be allowed to decline rent relief. Under the current rules, property owners can refuse to accept the subsidy. That\u2019s because the program would cover 80% of the debt and landlords would have to forgive the remaining 20%. Tenants could apply for assistance if their landlords rejected the subsidy, but they would only get 25% of their rent debt, which is enough to ensure they wouldn\u2019t be evicted when the moratorium ends. They would still owe the rest of the money.\n\nNewsom last month proposed covering 100% of rent debt for qualified tenants, using federal relief approved in March. He also said he wants to allow tenants to apply for the full amount themselves without relying on landlord cooperation. That should help. Still, tenant advocates worry that without explicit language in the law mandating acceptance by landlords, some property owners will refuse full reimbursement so they can get rid of particular tenants.\n\nThe federal government has given California an unprecedented $5 billion to help prevent a pandemic housing catastrophe. State leaders cannot allow renters to slip through the cracks.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nI went to see my doctor the other day for a Covid-delayed physical. Instead of talking about what ails me, he wanted to talk about what ails us. A dystopian country. The Babel of misinformation. The lack of trust in everybody and everything. \u201cAnd how did Dr. Fauci become the enemy?\u201d he said. My doctor is politically moderate and ambidextrously smart. After much steam had been let off, I wanted to say, Enough with American vitals \u2014 what about my own? Trust in institutions \u2014 government, the press, religion, big business \u2014 is at or near record lows. My own profession, journalism, has been kicked to the cellar of disdain. Almost 40 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in newspapers, according to Gallup\u2019s annual surveys \u2014 up from 24 percent in 2000. But the \u201cpress,\u201d where free speech and all its cacophonous chaos reside, has been a punching bag for some time. More shocking is that about 50 percent distrust our electoral system, according to a Morning Consult survey. Diminished confidence in elections is among the worst of the many awful legacies of Donald Trump.\n\nBut underlying these cynicisms and suspicions is a truly sad development: The United States is becoming a mean country. Take the story of the airline passenger who knocked out the teeth of a flight attendant \u2014 part of a frightening rise in unruly fliers. Or consider the man who shot and killed a Georgia supermarket cashier when she asked him to pull up his mask. Lament the absurd sorrow of the Philadelphia food festival that was designed to celebrate culinary diversity \u2014 then canceled after the decision to disinvite a food truck selling Israeli food sparked controversy. It was a truly shocking breach when Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Barack Obama in 2009. Now an entire political party is shouting the Big Lie of election fraud, and will punish those who insist on the truth. Tribalism, and the corrosive hatreds that go with it, has always been just below the surface in the risky experiment of our multiethnic democracy. Of late, it has surfaced in many of our daily interactions \u2014 and accounts for much of the meanness of this moment. I trace the contempt of the press to Rush Limbaugh, whose longstanding goal was to equate what he called the \u201cdrive-by media\u201d \u2014 that is, fact-checking news organizations staffed by underpaid people devoted to their craft \u2014 with fact-challenged, overcompensated, partisan gasbags like himself. It worked.\n\nOnce upon a time, the crackpots could mostly talk only to themselves on barstools; now they have an enormous community in the dark reaches of the web. That explains why up to one-fourth of Republicans believe the country is under the control of Satan-worshiping pedophiles, as they huff the vapors of QAnon. It\u2019s also the likely reason a third of Americans continue to believe the fiction that Joe Biden took the election through fraud. The jump from a provably false premise to physical attacks doesn\u2019t require skill. In mean America, in January, nearly three in 10 people surveyed expressed support for politically motivated violence, if necessary. Sadly, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol \u2014 so heartbreaking and so norm-shattering \u2014 was much more of a reflection of the times than an aberration. The left shares the blame, with its cancel culture, groupthink stridency and identity politics \u2014 tactics now picked up by the right. (See the canceled Liz Cheney, party fealty to the falsity that Trump won.) Last summer, some protesters showed up at the homes of elected officials in Seattle, including that of Debora Juarez, a solid progressive and the lone Indigenous member of the Seattle City Council. She said she felt they were there to \u201cterrorize\u201d her after she was taunted with bullhorn insults and menaced with flashing car headlights. Her crime: Ms. Juarez failed to back a goal to defund the police by 50 percent. The political class in the city was largely quiet. I\u2019ve been working on a book about the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, a time when up to five million Americans belonged to the nation\u2019s oldest hate group. That was a mean decade, with Jim Crow locked in place, Prohibition the law of the land and immigrants who weren\u2019t white Protestants all but locked out. A favorite tactic of the Klan in the \u201920s was night-riding to people\u2019s homes to terrorize them. The underlying theme of all this meanness is intolerance.",

            "content": "A committee formed to craft sweeping \u201canti-racist\u201d policies for a Rhode Island school district has refused to make its meetings public, prompting another legal challenge between those seeking to impose critical race theory in K-12 education and concerned parents and taxpayers.\n\nThe issue in Rhode Island\u2019s South Kingstown School District again pits the mother of a kindergartner there, Nicole Solas, against the combined weight of progressive administrators who have paid at least $5,000 so far to an outside consultant to run the policy-making committee.\n\nMs. Solas, who garnered national attention after speaking against CRT at a committee meeting in June, is now represented by the conservative Goldwater Institute. She filed her complaint with the Rhode Island attorney general after she was told she could not attend weekly meetings of the BIPOC Advisory Board, a group that began meeting last September to propose new policies for hiring, athletics, discipline and a host of other concerns for the K-12 public schools there.\n\nThe board is led by Robin Wildman, founder of Nonviolent Schools Rhode Island, who has been paid $7,474 for her services through June 30, according to school vendor records. It is expected to finish its work by August, and thus far the South Kingstown School Committee has given preliminary approval to the Board\u2019s proposed changes to its discrimination policy.\n\nIn a May interview with The Collective, a left-wing bookstore and \u201corganizing space\u201d in Peace Dale, Rhode Island, Ms. Wildman said she approached the school district with the idea for a \u201cBIPOC group that would look at policies and practices and make recommendations to create a more inclusive, antiracist district.\u201d BIPOC is an acronym that stands for Black, Indigenous and people of color.\n\nA retired 5th-grade teacher, Ms. Wildman said she believes teaching and activism go hand-in-hand.\n\n\u201cI believe in working for justice, not equal rights,\u201d she said, saying that systemic racism means \u201cthe vast majority of those that control all of the systems in our country are White.\n\n\u201cJustice means breaking down the oppressive systems that prevent BIPOC from accessing opportunities in your community that White people have,\u201d Ms. Wildman said.\n\nMs. Solas said she learned of the board\u2019s existence through a local news report, and that Ms. Wildman was being paid to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the board\u2019s meetings.\n\n\u201cWhen I learned that this board existed and was getting paid to revise school policies I asked to come and see the meetings and was told they are not open,\u201d Ms. Solas said. \u201cFor a year now, they have been squeezing all their policies through the lens of anti-racism and essentially injecting racism into everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnti-racism\u201d is a rapidly growing educational philosophy based on critical race theory, itself a recasting of U.S. history that supporters say rightfully puts slavery and racism at the center of the American experience. Critics, though, have decried the movement\u2019s shoddy scholarship and warned parents that the leftist ideology is little more than warmed-over Marxism filled with anti-American propaganda.\n\nLast June, in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a then-Minneapolis police officer, the South Kingstown School Committee declared its adherence to critical race theory in a public \u201cMessage of Solidarity.\u201d\n\n\u201cCritical knowledge, radical empathy and institutional action are non-negotiable,\u201d the former chairwoman Stephanie Canter wrote. \u201cThis is not a time for platitudes and distractions. This is a time for active anti-racism, nothing less.\u201d\n\nWhile some of those demands have surfaced for Committee discussion since then, Ms. Solas contends the School Committee and K-12 administrators have consistently sought to dodge public scrutiny of their actions. Earlier this year, the Committee threatened to sue Ms. Solas after she filed some 200 public records requests, and when the Goldwater Institute took over the case and requested public records and emails it was told the latter would cost more than $74,000 to provide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with that,\u201d said Jon Riches, an attorney with the Goldwater Institute.\n\nThe School District did not respond to phone calls Thursday. Its superintendent recently resigned, as did Committee Chairwoman Emily Cummiskey, who said the atmosphere was too fraught with dissension.\n\nThe question about the BIPOC Advisory Board could become moot if the Rhode Island Democratic attorney general Peter Neronha does not rule before its weekly meetings conclude, although there are legal remedies should the courts rule the Board\u2019s taxpayer-funded meetings should have been open to the public, Mr. Riches said.\n\nCalls and emails to Mr. Neronha\u2019s office were not returned Thursday.",

            "content": "Clothing manufacturer Patagonia joined pipeline opponents in celebrating the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, even though the outdoor-apparel maker\u2019s product line heavily relies on petroleum.\n\nIn a Thursday post, Patagonia retweeted a message from the Native Organizers Alliance declaring that the \u201c#KXL Pipeline is DONE,\u201d referring to TC Energy\u2019s decision Wednesday to abandon the 1,700-mile U.S.-Canada project after a 13-year battle.\n\n\u201cA big congratulations to all!\u201d Patagonia tweeted. \u201c\u2019The termination of this zombie pipeline sets precedent for President Biden and polluters to stop Line 3, Dakota Access, and all fossil fuel projects,\u2019 Kendall Mackey, campaign manager of http://350.org\u2018s Keep It in the Ground campaign.\u201d\n\nPatagonia also retweeted a post from the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the company\u2019s environmental grantees, declaring that \u201cwe have finally defeated an oil and gas giant! Keystone XL is DEAD!\u201d\n\nCalifornia-based Patagonia has long opposed Keystone, decrying President Trump\u2019s 2017 decision to approve the U.S.-Canada cross-border permit and thanking President Biden for canceling it in January, even though the firm\u2019s jackets, backpacks and gear are made with nylon, polyester and other petroleum-based fibers.\n\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, described Patagonia as \u201ca company that wants to pretend it uses no oil, yet just about every one of its products contains petroleum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t manufacture their products without oil and natural gas, and neither could their products get to customers or their customers to the trails,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nThe message comes as woke companies come under scrutiny for their fossil-fuel usage. Last year, the North Face came under fire for refusing to fill a jacket order for a drilling services firm in Houston.\n\nChris Wright, president of Liberty Oilfield Services in Denver, responded last week with a billboard and social media campaign \u201cthanking\u201d North Face for being \u201can extraordinary customer of the oil-and-gas industry.\u201d\n\nHe said that 60% of all clothing fibers globally are made of oil and gas, but that he was unable to find a single product in the North Face catalog without a petroleum component.\n\nWhen it comes to climate activism, however, few companies can hang with Patagonia, which said it provided financial support last year to 1,020 environmental groups, including Honor the Earth and 350.org, as part of its Patagonia Action Works campaign.\n\nPatagonia even sells a T-shirt with the message \u201cDitch the Drill: We Can\u2019t Afford Another Spill.\u201d\n\nUnlike many corporations, however, Patagonia appears to acknowledge the disconnect between its product line and its environmental activism.\n\nPatagonia has sought to mitigate its carbon footprint by using recycled plastics in its products, saying that \u201c64% of our fabrics this season are made with recycled materials,\u201d with a goal of 100% renewable and recycled raw materials, and that 100% of its U.S. electricity use came from renewable sources.\n\nLast year, the company adopted the mission statement \u201cwe\u2019re in business to save the home planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatagonia is one of the most progressive marketers and distributors of outdoor clothing in the U.S and beyond,\u201d said the announcement. \u201cThe business model of this company is impressive especially in how it targets its customers through affordable pricing of its products.\u201d\n\nLarry Behrens, Western states director of Power the Future, disagreed, pointing to Patagonia\u2019s Grace VII Down Parka jacket, priced at a cool $899.\n\n\u201cCorporate hypocrisy is never a good look, but it\u2019s even worse from a company like Patagonia celebrates the destruction of American blue-collar jobs and then has the arrogance to sell a jacket for $900,\u201d said Mr. Behrens. \u201cThe fact of the matter is companies like Patagonia rely on oil for their business no matter how much they cuddle up to radical environmentalists.\u201d\n\nKeystone XL was intended to move about 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Alberta to an existing pipeline hook-up in Steele City, Nebraska, creating an estimated 42,000 jobs and $2 billion in associated U.S. earnings.\n\nWhile foes cite the environmental dangers from leaks or spills, Keystone supporters argued that pipelines are far more environmentally friendly than the alternatives, such as railroads, trucks and ships.\n\n\u201cKeystone would have safely transported oil produced in Canada and America, so Patagonia is cheering the production of oil from countries where it\u2019s not produced under strict environmental controls and with respect for human rights,\u201d said Ms. Sgamma. \u201cBravo Patagonia.\u201d",

            "summary": "Clothing manufacturer Patagonia joined pipeline opponents in celebrating the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, even though the outdoor-apparel maker\u2019s product line heavily relies on petroleum. \n\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, described Patagonia as \u201ca company that wants to pretend it uses no oil, yet just about every one of its products contains petroleum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t manufacture their products without oil and natural gas, and neither could their products get to customers or their customers to the trails,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nThe message comes as woke companies come under scrutiny for their fossil-fuel usage. Last year, the North Face came under fire for refusing to fill a jacket order for a drilling services firm in Houston.\n\nChris Wright, president of Liberty Oilfield Services in Denver, responded last week with a billboard and social media campaign \u201cthanking\u201d North Face for being \u201can extraordinary customer of the oil-and-gas industry.\u201d\n\nHe said that 60% of all clothing fibers globally are made of oil and gas, but that he was unable to find a single product in the North Face catalog without a petroleum component.\n\nWhen it comes to climate activism, however, few companies can hang with Patagonia, which said it provided financial support last year to 1,020 environmental groups, including Honor the Earth and 350.org, as part of its Patagonia Action Works campaign.\n\nPatagonia even sells a T-shirt with the message \u201cDitch the Drill: We Can\u2019t Afford Another Spill.\u201d\n\nUnlike many corporations, however, Patagonia appears to acknowledge the disconnect between its product line and its environmental activism.\n\nPatagonia has sought to mitigate its carbon footprint by using recycled plastics in its products, saying that \u201c64% of our fabrics this season are made with recycled materials,\u201d with a goal of 100% renewable and recycled raw materials, and that 100% of its U.S. electricity use came from renewable sources.\n\nLast year, the company adopted the mission statement \u201cwe\u2019re in business to save the home planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatagonia is one of the most progressive marketers and distributors of outdoor clothing in the U.S and beyond,\u201d said the announcement. \u201cThe fact of the matter is companies like Patagonia rely on oil for their business no matter how much they cuddle up to radical environmentalists.\u201d\n\nKeystone XL was intended to move about 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Alberta to an existing pipeline hook-up in Steele City, Nebraska, creating an estimated 42,000 jobs and $2 billion in associated U.S. earnings.",

            "title": "Michael Pollan's New Book Examines The War On Drugs",
            "description": "Michael Pollan's New Book Examines The War On Drugs  Forbes",
            "content": "Author and educator Michael Pollan delivers a commentary on our love-hate relationship with drugs in his latest book, This Is Your Mind on Plants, which debuted at #2 this week on the New York Times list of best sellers. An examination of just three of the myriad psychoactive chemicals human beings indulge in\u2014caffeine, opium and mescaline\u2014Pollan\u2019s work reveals how tightly these molecules are intertwined in our culture and most of our personal lives.\n\nA central theme of This Is Your Mind on Plants is America\u2019s (and by extension, the international community\u2019s) War on Drugs. The book, the title of which is itself an allusion to the drug war, begins with a magazine article about opium Pollan penned for Harper\u2019s Magazine in 1996. A garden writer at the time, the story was inspired when Pollan\u2019s editor shared an underground book titled Opium for the Masses, where he learned that opium tea could be made by growing plants from readily available seed.\n\n\u201cThe book is an effort to launch a conversation, a kind of post-drug war conversation,\u201d Pollan tells me in a telephone interview. \u201cI start out with the drug war, and that\u2019s why the first chapter is all about my adventure growing opium poppies.\u201d\n\nAfter sowing the seeds, the purveyors of which promised striking blooms in shades of red, orange, lavender and more, Pollan began investigating the legal implications of cultivating the garden plants. He quickly learned that he had already stepped out of bounds in the eyes of the nation\u2019s drug laws. Just by knowingly planting the seeds in his Connecticut garden, the author had committed a federal offense.\n\nAlthough he was alarmed at the revelation, the discovery that he had already run afoul of federal drug statute eventually emboldened Pollan. When he first sowed the seeds in spring, Pollan was unsure just how far he would take his experiment. But when he learned he was already technically a drug offender, he decided to go ahead and make the tea Opium for the Masses had taught him could be easily prepared from the seed pods that followed the colorful flowers.\n\nBut the passage Pollan wrote for his article detailing his preparation of the tea and its effect on him raised even more legal issues. Jim Hogshire, who wrote Opium for the Masses, was facing drug charges in Seattle for manufacturing controlled substances following a police raid on his residence. Additionally, Pollan had learned that the Drug Enforcement Administration had been quietly investigating seed companies and dried flower vendors who offered products derived from opium poppies.\n\nThe attention the authorities were affording gardeners and flower arrangers gave Pollan pause. Would publishing the article attract the notice of drug agents or prosecutors? To find out, Harper\u2019s publisher John R. \u201cRick\u201d MacArthur solicited a legal opinion from a prominent criminal defense attorney. The news wasn\u2019t good. Pollan learned that a zealous prosecutor could see the story as a criminal confession and bring charges against him. And if he were not convicted or even charged, an encounter with the government could lead to the seizure of his family home under civil asset forfeiture laws.\n\nMacArthur, who saw Pollan\u2019s article as work protected by the Constitution, was not satisfied with the legal opinion and sought another from a different lawyer, this time one specializing in the First Amendment. The attorney agreed with MacArthur, saying the article was protected commentary on the government that should be published. The convoluted and arbitrary nature of the nation\u2019s narcotics laws clearly on display, Pollan was faced with a decision that could impact his freedom and the home he shared with his wife and young son. Reluctantly, Pollan decided to excise the pages about opium tea from the final draft of the article, which was published in the April 1997 edition of Harper\u2019s Magazine under the title \u201cOpium Made Easy.\u201d\n\nAlmost a quarter-century later, the deleted passage appears for the first time publicly in This Is Your Mind on Plants. The statute of limitations for any potentially alleged crimes long since passed, Pollan is no longer in legal jeopardy for feloniously brewing tea. But the notion that the pages he had written could have landed him in jail almost seems silly in retrospect, particularly in the context of the opioid epidemic instigated by Purdue Pharma, the drug company that began marketing OxyContin at practically the same time Pollan was planting his poppy seeds.\n\nIf he were writing \u201cOpium Made Easy\u201d today, Pollan says he would probably publish the piece in its entirety, noting that the War on Drugs seems to be in retreat and \u201cthings have changed dramatically since then.\u201d After the fear of reprisal subsided, it didn\u2019t take long for Pollan to regret the self-censorship.\n\n\u201cGiven the opioid crisis, it\u2019s really hard to imagine the government coming after somebody for growing some opium poppies and making a cup of poppy tea,\u201d he explains.\n\nAfter beginning This Is Your Mind on Plants with opium, Pollan next explores \u201ca legal drug, caffeine, to help us think through: how do we feel about addiction?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it, and why are some drugs celebrated and others condemned?\u201d\n\nQuestions like these further illustrate the capriciousness of the War on Drugs and what substances policymakers choose to prohibit. For example, although caffeine is a highly addictive psychoactive drug, its use is not just tolerated but celebrated in a society that increasingly demands our attention at all hours of the day and night. The use of caffeine is so pervasive, with approximately 90% of the world\u2019s population regularly ingesting it, that Pollan\u2019s self-experimentation with the drug for This Is Your Life on Plants involved abstaining rather than partaking.\n\nBut caffeine hasn\u2019t always enjoyed such wide acceptance. At various times in Europe and the Arabic world, Pollan notes, coffee has been banned because of its association with establishments that foment politically threatening ideas. Other psychoactive substances have also seen their favor ebb and flow with the whims of popular opinion. After a hard day crusading against the perils of alcohol in the years leading up to Prohibition, members of the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union would unwind with \u201cwomen\u2019s tonics\u201d containing laudanum, a form of morphine that was perfectly legal at the time. Cannabis, another drug regaining acceptance today, was a popular and commonly available analgesic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nPsychedelic drugs, too, have seen their fate impacted by the arbitrary whims of the War on Drugs. Hailed as a potential psychiatric breakthrough in early studies during the 1950s and 60s, hallucinogenic drugs became a victim of the drug war launched by the Nixon administration to contain the dual threats of the anti-war and civil rights movements. And now, it seems, the pendulum is swinging the other way again, with researchers studying the potential of psychedelics to treat mental health conditions including depression, anxiety and addiction. When the New York Times ran a recent cover story on the current psychedelic revolution, the Gray Lady credited Pollan\u2019s 2018 best-selling book How to Change Your Mind with playing a pivotal role in helping to \u201cdestigmatize the drugs in the three years since it was published.\u201d\n\nFor the last chapter of This Is Your Mind on Plants, Pollan turns to mescaline, a psychedelic drug found in the peyote and San Pedro cacti that can also be created synthetically. The author says that he is looking ahead to a time when psychedelics are decriminalized, noting that \u201cwe are going to have to figure out what to do with them.\u201d\n\nCurrently, mescaline is a schedule 1 controlled substance under federal drug laws, making it illegal for everyone besides specially licensed researchers. The only exception is for members of the Native American Church. They have used peyote sacramentally since the denomination\u2019s inception in the late 1880s, when the United States\u2019 indigenous people and their culture were threatened by annihilation. Spiritual use of peyote likely began thousands of years before that. In 1620, the Mexican Inquisition declared peyote a \u201cheretical perversity,\u201d making it the first drug to be banned in the New World.\n\nThis varied approach to mescaline serves as another example of how drugs are viewed and controlled. While the Spanish Conquest saw peyote as a threat to the Catholic Church and the U.S. government feared psychedelics were a danger to society, members of the Native American Church use peyote to bring the community together and address the challenges it faces in the forms of illness, domestic strife and addiction, as well as individual and generational trauma.\n\nDespite the current renaissance in psychedelic therapy, many Native Americans would not like to see peyote legalized. Endangered in the wild, the cactus is native only to a narrow band of land alongside the Rio Grande in Mexico and Texas. Poaching and unsustainable legal harvesting in its natural habit worry many Native Americans that supplies of the sacred plant will be threatened.\n\n\u201cSo, it becomes important to look for models of sane and sustainable use of psychedelics,\u201d Pollan maintains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I focused on traditional cultures, indigenous cultures, who I think have a lot to teach us on how to fold these substances into our lives.\u201d\n\nAs we navigate the path to the end of the War on Drugs, Pollan believes that new regulatory regimes will have to be created, noting that he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink the future of psilocybin lies with the cannabis dispensary. I think it\u2019s a very different kind of experience and needs a very different kind of container to be used safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopefully bringing the drug war to a close. The next question is, what does the drug peace look like? And it\u2019s not simple of legalization or decriminalization,\u201d he continues. \u201cSociety is still going to have to figure out how to handle these powerful substances in such a way that people who want them have access to them, and that the harms are minimized, and that their full benefit as tools for health or spiritual development can be realized.\u201d\n\nMichael Pollan\u2019s This Is Your Mind on Plants from Penguin Press is available now at your favorite bookseller and from the usual cadre of online retailers.",

A garden writer at the time, the story was inspired when Pollan\u2019s editor shared an underground book titled Opium for the Masses, where he learned that opium tea could be made by growing plants from readily available seed. Although he was alarmed at the revelation, the discovery that he had already run afoul of federal drug statute eventually emboldened Pollan. Reluctantly, Pollan decided to excise the pages about opium tea from the final draft of the article, which was published in the April 1997 edition of Harper\u2019s Magazine under the title \u201cOpium Made Easy.\u201d\n\nAlmost a quarter-century later, the deleted passage appears for the first time publicly in This Is Your Mind on Plants.",

            "content": "Claims of \u201creligious liberty\u201d are being used to justify discrimination \u2014 and that is not good for religious freedom or American democracy.\n\nThe Supreme Court sidestepped the issue this week with its narrowly tailored 9-0 decision in Fulton vs. Philadelphia. Still, the justices held that Philadelphia\u2019s enforcement of anti-discrimination policies \u2014 telling Catholic Social Services that the agency needed to be willing to certify same-sex couples as foster parents in order to renew their contract for foster care \u2014 violated the 1st Amendment.\n\nWhile we are relieved that the court did not go further to make it impossible to enforce anti-discrimination laws when people or organizations claim a religious reason for their bias, we are very concerned that a religious agency receiving government funding is allowed to ignore laws designed to protect marginalized and minoritized individuals.\n\nIt is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, when religious liberty claims were used to defend schools that had been established primarily to circumvent federal laws against racial segregation. These claims were denied, but if religion is a good enough reason to discriminate based on sexual orientation, then why not race? How about religious difference? In 2019, Miracle Hill Ministries in South Carolina got a waiver to participate in federally funded foster care even though it turns away Jews, Muslims and others \u2014 working only with Christians.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, nine federal agencies proposed new rules legalizing discrimination under the guise of religious liberty. Among other things, those rules exempt government-funded faith-based agencies from laws that guarantee equal access to programs. They expand religious exemptions to laws against discrimination in hiring. They also support health professionals who refused to treat patients on religious grounds.\n\nThe Biden administration is working to unwind some of these rules, but the larger question remains: Why do some religious people and organizations continue to believe that faith offers them constitutional protection to discriminate?\n\nAs scholars dedicated to studying the role of religion in politics and public life, we are profoundly troubled that religious freedom is increasingly invoked and interpreted as a kind of diplomatic immunity from the rule of law.\n\nThe problem is deepened because religious freedom is protected for some more than others. Religious liberty was not honored when the Indigenous community tried to protect their sacred lands at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Bears Ears or Standing Rock. It was not protected when the third iteration of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d passed constitutional muster. It is not protected when religious pacifists seek to withhold the portion of their taxes that funds the military.\n\nWhy are questions of sexuality and procreation the dominant issues that get affirmed as matters of religious liberty? Our traditions have much more to say about affirming the value and dignity of all life, caring for the environment, pursuing peace, fostering an inclusive society, welcoming the stranger and eliminating poverty. Where are these issues on the religious liberty agenda?\n\nThere are, of course, legitimate questions regarding the best standard for decision-making when government policies bump up against religious practice or belief. The courts have considered whether a law is neutral among religions in its impact, whether there are secular exceptions to the law that would require religious ones as well, and whether the government should have to prove it has a compelling interest that might override free exercise.\n\nBut equality under the law is also a constitutionally protected right. In the last dissent she wrote before her death, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned that the court was breaking from its long-standing principles in allowing \u201cthe religious beliefs of some to overwhelm the rights and interests of others who do not share those beliefs,\u201d even when they are causing harm.\n\nThe House has reintroduced a bill called the \u201cDo No Harm Act\u201d specifically designed to protect against using religious liberty as a shield for discrimination. We hope that it becomes law, but, in the meantime, it would be a good rule of thumb for religious organizations and individuals. Evocative of the principle of ahimsa in Jain, Buddhist and Hindu traditions, many religions in fact teach that we must avoid actions that might harm others.\n\nReligious individuals and organizations have an obligation to balance what they believe with a plural understanding of the broader public good. It requires standing both inside and outside our traditions to examine their impact. We can best protect religious liberty by refusing to wield it as a weapon to hurt others.\n\nRachel S.

            "description": "Canlis Hires Its First Female Executive Chef  The New York Times",
            "content": "Aisha Ibrahim is the new executive chef of Canlis in Seattle, the first woman ever to hold the position in the 70 years the restaurant has been operating.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nSince closing its dining room in March 2020, Canlis has reinvented itself several times over, shape-shifting from Seattle\u2019s loftiest fine-dining restaurant into a bagel shop, a crab shack and a drive-in movie theater. Now, the restaurant has made another, more permanent change, hiring Aisha Ibrahim as its new executive chef. Ms. Ibrahim, 35, is the seventh chef, and the first woman, to helm the Canlis kitchen in its 70-year history. She started work on April 30. Ms. Ibrahim succeeds Brady Williams, who ended a six-year run at Canlis in February, and who plans to open his own restaurant in Seattle later this year. Canlis opened in 1950 in a striking midcentury modern building with views of Lake Union, serving a menu of surf-and-turf classics with a Pacific inflection. In recent years, under the leadership of its third-generation owners, the brothers Mark and Brian Canlis, it has evolved from a beloved local institution to a player on the national fine-dining stage. Jason Franey, who arrived from New York City\u2019s Eleven Madison Park as executive chef in 2008, revamped the menu in a modernist idiom: more artful plating, with more crumbs, foams and emulsions.\n\nMr. Williams, who brought a renewed focus on Asian techniques and ingredients, took over in 2015. In 2017, Canlis won its first James Beard award, for Outstanding Wine Program, under the wine and spirits director Nelson Daquip. In 2019, Mr. Williams was named Best Chef: Northwest, and the restaurant received the Design Icon Award in celebration of its remarkable home. In hiring Ms. Ibrahim, Canlis will continue to look to Asia for culinary inspiration. Born Zsahleya Aisha Ibrahim in the southern Philippines, Ms. Ibrahim immigrated to West Virginia at the age of 6. (She is the fourth executive chef at Canlis with Asian heritage.) She attended college on a basketball scholarship, but when an injury ended her sports career, she applied to Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in San Francisco. Ms. Ibrahim worked her way up through Bay Area kitchens to become a sous chef at Manresa, the three-Michelin-star restaurant in Los Gatos, Calif., before moving to the Basque region of Spain in 2015 to work for the chef Eneko Atxa at Azurmendi. Ms. Ibrahim went on to become chef de cuisine at Aziamendi, Azurmendi\u2019s sister restaurant in southern Thailand. Before joining Canlis, she spent two years preparing to open her own fine-dining project in Bangkok, which was scuttled by the Covid-19 pandemic. Ms. Ibrahim\u2019s partner, Samantha Beaird, will join the staff at Canlis, too, in the newly created position of research and development chef. Ms. Ibrahim said that she was drawn to Seattle for the unparalleled quality of ingredients from the forests, fisheries and farms of the Pacific Northwest. She plans to spend her time at Canlis exploring the region\u2019s Indigenous ingredients, the nuances of its microseasons and the city\u2019s historic role as a gateway to Asia.\n\nMs. Ibrahim admitted to being surprised to find herself back in the United States, having sworn off the country\u2019s brutal kitchen culture for jobs in Spain and Thailand, which have afforded her a more balanced lifestyle. \u201cFine dining in the United States has burned out my generation of leadership to the point where we\u2019re asking, \u2018Do I really want to do this?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut Canlis is very much a people-first program. I\u2019ve been around the block in terms of working at high-end restaurants, and that\u2019s not at all common.\u201d After a pair of Zoom interviews for the job, Ms. Ibrahim flew from Bangkok to Seattle \u2014 her second-ever visit to the city \u2014 to prepare a seven-course meal that sealed the deal. Mark Canlis described her cooking as simple, understated and sophisticated. \u201cHer food was an invitation in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t flexing or showmanship.\u201d The chefs at Canlis have always been like honorary family members, Mr. Canlis said, and hiring a new one can feel \u201clike adding a sibling.\u201d Cooking skills are just the table stakes. \u201cWhat makes Aisha the best chef for this restaurant has to do with caring for people, leading people and creating a culture,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has a desire to build a better industry, but she\u2019s already living that kind of life, and invested in people in the kind of way that inspires us.\u201d The leadership change comes on the heels of a year that has been the most turbulent, but creatively fertile, in the restaurant\u2019s history. Casting about for ways to keep their staff employed during the pandemic, the Canlis brothers have busied the team delivering meals around Seattle, serving burgers and bagels from the restaurant\u2019s parking lot, and hosting virtual bingo shows.",

            "title": "3 Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now",
            "description": "3 Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now  The New York Times",
            "content": "Even if you\u2019ve been attending performances and exhibitions at the Kitchen for decades, it\u2019s harder now than ever to locate this nondescript former industrial building on 19th Street: It\u2019s been swallowed up in a maze of residential towers and luxury boutiques in Chelsea. Alan Ruiz\u2019s blunt, spare but impressive exhibition \u201cContainer and Contained,\u201d addresses some these problems. Ruiz is a New York-based artist and writer whose work explores the politics of architecture and the built environment. His most prominent work here is an installation in the ground-level black box theater titled \u201cWS-C-62A; WS-C-62B\u201d (2021). Made primarily of steel and glass, it cuts up the space like a fragmentary wall or viewing platform. Every day, about eight minutes before the gallery closes, flood lights come on and Philip Glass\u2019s \u201cDance IX\u201d (1986) is blasted throughout the space, a reminder of the institution\u2019s earlier avant-garde days. Less obvious are the documents that make up \u201cTransfer II (WS-B690-L40)\u201d (2021), displayed on the gallery\u2019s north wall, which detail how Ruiz has leased the Kitchen\u2019s remaining air rights from the city for a year, for $1 per month. Combining various recognizable strains of recent art \u2014 minimalism, conceptualism, pedagogy, institutional critique \u2014 Ruiz addresses the ways in which smaller institutions like the Kitchen have been engulfed by the titanic wake of real estate development and gentrification. It\u2019s a depressing narrative, but Ruiz\u2019s cleareyed approach mostly shuns nostalgia. Instead, he identifies and occupies the spaces that artists can still claim \u2014 or rent for a pittance \u2014 within a vastly altered New York.\n\nThe first time I saw a New Red Order (N.R.O.) video, I laughed \u2014 and then wondered if it was OK to laugh. The actor Jim Fletcher, calling himself a \u201creformed Native American impersonator,\u201d was recruiting viewers to become informants for the N.R.O., an art collective that\u2019s also a kind of secret society. The video was a pitch-perfect parody of a promo for something like a weight-loss program, only the goals were decolonization and the cultivation of Indigenous futures. It felt like a brilliant joke whose punchline was a genuine appeal to someone like me, a white person living on land taken from the Lenape. The N.R.O. \u2014 whose core contributors are the artists Adam and Zack Khalil and Jackson Polys \u2014 now has a major exhibition at Artists Space, titled \u201cFeel at Home Here.\u201d The zany upstairs installation includes two semisatirical videos, graphics on the walls, branded beach products, and an imitation real-estate office for land repatriation. It also delves into two points of history: New York City\u2019s seal, which features an amiable \u201cNative American of Manhattan,\u201d and the Improved Order of Red Men, a nationalistic secret society founded in 1834 by and for white men, who structured it based on their fantasies of Native society. Downstairs, lightboxes and videos take serious aim at well-known, stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans by the sculptor James Earle Fraser. Although this is the N.R.O.\u2019s largest show yet, the nature of the group remains elusive \u2014 which is precisely the point. Its gift is shrewd mutability. Using a mash-up of strategies and styles, the N.R.O. illuminates pervasive violence against Native Americans, but then, instead of letting perpetrators off the hook, urges us to do something with our guilt.\n\nUnrequited passions are central to the seven artists in \u201cWish,\u201d a group exhibition about the productive pleasure of uncovering and anticipating the fulfillment of our hidden desires. That fulfillment can be subversively erotic, as indicated by several works in the show and most unsettlingly by Torbjorn Rodland\u2019s series of photographs that tinge ordinary instances of human interaction with eeriness, like the outstretched pair of hands touching a funereal floral arrangement (\u201cFloor Flowers,\u201d 2015), or a mouth pried open in a medical office (\u201cIntraoral no. 2,\u201d 2015). In Heji Shin\u2019s suggestive photographs, these discomfiting scenes extend to the animal kingdom, with the artist pairing common creatures with human nudity, as with \u201cDick and Snake\u201d (2018), or allowing barnyard creatures to function as innuendos in themselves, such as in \u201cBig Cock 7\u201d (2020), a close-up shot of a rooster. Though their punch lines may seem obvious or juvenile, Shin\u2019s photographs home in on the exhibition\u2019s emphasis on the tenuous connections, often humorous and disarming, between our desires and their real-world analogues. Nora Turato\u2019s 2021 wall piece \u201cThis little piggy went to market\u201d announces, with a perfect deadpan tenor, the omnipresence of the gig economy (\u201cleft his staff job to write a newsletter\u201d) via the psychedelic patterns and sans-serif typeface of corporate advertising. In a similarly acerbic fashion, Elliot Reed presents a mound of salt \u2014 163.2 pounds worth, equal to the artist\u2019s body weight \u2014 within the gallery, atop of which is placed the clothes the artist wore while on a video call with his loved ones. The 2020 work, \u201cEnd-to-End Encrypted (Lot\u2019s Wife),\u201d succeeds in signaling the bodily absence that video technology seeks to mitigate, but also evocatively alludes, like the exhibition as a whole, to the acutely felt sensations of longing for those dear and far away.",

The actor Jim Fletcher, calling himself a \u201creformed Native American impersonator,\u201d was recruiting viewers to become informants for the N.R.O., an art collective that\u2019s also a kind of secret society. It also delves into two points of history: New York City\u2019s seal, which features an amiable \u201cNative American of Manhattan,\u201d and the Improved Order of Red Men, a nationalistic secret society founded in 1834 by and for white men, who structured it based on their fantasies of Native society. That fulfillment can be subversively erotic, as indicated by several works in the show and most unsettlingly by Torbjorn Rodland\u2019s series of photographs that tinge ordinary instances of human interaction with eeriness, like the outstretched pair of hands touching a funereal floral arrangement (\u201cFloor Flowers,\u201d 2015), or a mouth pried open in a medical office (\u201cIntraoral no. 2,\u201d 2015).",

            "content": "The National Archives is asking for public donations as it tries to keep tens of thousands of records from disintegrating.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe National Archives\u2019 funding crisis has sparked a discussion about whether we undervalue our country\u2019s history.\n\nThe Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. \u201cWe are in a race to preserve and digitize precious Australian records before they\u2019re lost forever \u2014 and we need your help,\u201d Australia\u2019s pre-eminent repository of government records declared on its website and on social media. \u201cDonate now.\u201d For the first time, the National Archives is asking for public donations as it tries to keep tens of thousands of records from disintegrating. After what experts describe as decades of funding cuts, the last straw seemed to come last month, when the Archives was given an increase of just $700,000 in the federal budget. That was a drop in the bucket compared to the $67 million it says it needs to digitize its rapidly deteriorating audiovisual collection by 2025, when much of the equipment used for playback may likely fail. The spectacle of an institution that, in its own words, \u201csafeguards the nation\u2019s memory\u201d resorting to crowdfunding has been labeled a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and an \u201cinternational embarrassment\u201d by historians. There seems to be something deep in Australia\u2019s cultural DNA \u2014 or at least in its political class \u2014 that makes it hard to value preserving and exploring the country\u2019s past. Or at least certain parts of it \u2014 much has been said about how the National War Memorial, in contrast, has been granted $500 million for renovation.\n\nEven Prince Charles has been drawn into the matter, after a prominent British historian wrote to his office to alert him that records related to the mutiny on the Bounty were disintegrating. (Prince Charles has made no public comment on the matter.) Also at risk, according to the Archives, are tape recordings of prime ministers\u2019 wartime speeches, recordings that document Indigenous languages and ceremonies, and Australian Security Intelligence Organization footage from years of surveillance of trade unions and leftist groups. The Archives has had its fair share of controversies, including a protracted and expensive legal battle to keep secret the \u201cPalace Papers,\u201d which contained information about Gough Whitlam\u2019s 1975 dismissal by the then-governor-general, and historians\u2019 complaints that it sometimes takes up to a decade to gain access to documents. The assistant minister in charge of the archives, Amanda Stoker, has defended the decision not to allocate extra funding, saying that the government was at a point where it needed to decide whether to maintain the current record-keeping system or invest in a new, more cost-efficient method. She said that \u201cwhen that is done we will all be pleased that we put the money into the new system.\u201d \u201cTime marches on, and all sources degrade over time,\u201d Ms. Stoker said at a recent Senate hearing. But the Archives\u2019 director general, David Fricker, said that when we lose records of the government, we damage the integrity of its processes and the trust that people place in their leaders.\n\n\u201cIf governments know and government officials know that they will be held to account because these records will be made available one day, it just gives us that little bit of incentive to make sure that we are acting with propriety and we are acting in the best interest of the public,\u201d he said in a radio interview. So much of what we see of politics now is focused on the day-to-day trading of insults on the floor of Parliament, said Nicholas Brown, a history professor at Australia National University. To build a more nuanced and long-term understanding of politics, including the work and decision-making that happen behind the scenes, historical records like those contained in the archives are vital, he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have access to that material, we have a narrower sense of what politics used to look like,\u201d Professor Brown said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have that, we\u2019re less able to critically engage with what politics is like now.\u201d It\u2019s not just records of government that are at risk, notes Michelle Arrow, an associate professor of modern history at Macquarie University. Also in jeopardy are records of ordinary Australian lives that just happened to brush against government institutions. Another issue is that we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in the archives. If records continue to deteriorate, \u201cwe won\u2019t know what we\u2019ll lose until a researcher tries to find them in 20 years\u2019 time and discovers they\u2019ve degraded,\u201d Professor Arrow said.

            "description": "Biden administration's excuses for denying fireworks at Mount Rushmore is pure politics  Washington Times",
            "content": "One of the most alarming elements of the Biden administration so far is its blatant and unapologetic willingness to use its enforcement powers in arbitrary ways to hurt its political appointments.\n\nProtesters in Portland barricade police in buildings then set them ablaze but are not even charged with crimes before they are released; meanwhile, Jan. 6 protesters languish under harsh conditions for five months now in solitary confinement while they await trials on what are at most minor felonies.\n\nA pipeline between Germany and Russia, which enables Russia to gain hard currency and significant geopolitical influence by selling energy in Europe, is approved just days ahead of a meeting between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But Keystone Pipeline, which generates American jobs and affordable energy for Americans, is rejected to appease leftist green groups.\n\nNow, South Dakota wants to hold a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, and the Biden administration is refusing to allow it. The official excuse is that it is too dangerous \u2013 too much risk of fire or exposure to covid \u2013 and that tribes oppose it because two of the presidents etched into the rock were slave owners.\n\nPresident Biden has actively encouraged state and local governments to hold lavish Fourth of July celebrations this year to mark the country\u2019s independence from the pandemic, so the argument about COVID-19 spread is disingenuous to say the least.\n\nThe National Park Service looked into whether the fire hazard argument held water last year, found it did not and approved the first Fourth of July celebration there in more than a decade.\n\nFormer President Trump spoke before about 8,000 people who were not required to wear masks. Not only were there no fires, there was no uptick in COVID-19 cases in South Dakota over the next two weeks, indicating it was not the super spreader event detractors had predicted.\n\nAs for the tribes, the park has been there 80 years \u2013 since when have they been given veto power over programming there?\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said she had addressed all the environmental concerns raised by the National Park Service, all the fire precautions, checklists and consultations. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re not letting South Dakota have our fireworks at Mount Rushmore is just political,\u201d Noem said on Fox News Tuesday night.\n\nAfter a judge told her earlier this month that he wouldn\u2019t overturn the Department of Interior\u2019s decision to deny the state a permit to hold the fireworks show, she vowed to resubmit the application in hopes the government will reverse the decision in time to put on the show. On top of that, she said she would write to President Biden directly.\n\nGov. Noem has pointed out in tweets and elsewhere that Biden will get to have a Fourth of July celebration in his front yard. The Bidens are playing host to about 1,000 guests for a barbecue on the White House lawn \u2013 most of them first responders who are being thanked for their efforts during the pandemic.\n\nSo what is the real reason? Is the Biden administration denying South Dakota the use of Mount Rushmore for its Fourth of July celebration out of political pique at a successful Republican governor who happens to be on a lot of short-lists for the 2024 presidential nomination?\n\nIs it because this particular governor defied the CDC, truly trusted the science and kept her state open throughout the pandemic, enabling it to emerge as one of the hottest states economically in the country?\n\nIs the Democratic Party so resentful of Mr. Trump that it would deny innocent South Dakotans a Fourth of July celebration it is actively encouraging everywhere else just because he spoke there last year?\n\nDo the tribes hold that much sway? Will they get a right of veto over all park programming? From the remarks of some of their members \u2013 \u201cMount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy, of structural racism that\u2019s still alive and well in society today,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201dan injustice to actively steal indigenous people\u2019s land, then carve the white faces of the colonizers who committed genocide,\u201d said one \u2013 it seems as if it will take more than canceling a fireworks show to satisfy them.\n\nWhatever it is, the Biden administration needs to either approve South Dakota\u2019s fireworks show or actually explain why it won\u2019t. it\u2019s not because of covid, or the president wouldn\u2019t be encouraging every other locality in America to hold a celebration. It\u2019s not fire safety \u2013 South Dakota has proven it has that under control.\n\nAbsent that, we have to assume it\u2019s politics, the arbitrary abuse of power for which this administration is becoming known. No other explanation makes much sense.\n\u2022 Brian McNicoll, a freelance writer based in Alexandria, Va., is a former senior writer for The Heritage Foundation and former director of communications for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",

Not only were there no fires, there was no uptick in COVID-19 cases in South Dakota over the next two weeks, indicating it was not the super spreader event detractors had predicted.\n\nAs for the tribes, the park has been there 80 years \u2013 since when have they been given veto power over programming there?\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said she had addressed all the environmental concerns raised by the National Park Service, all the fire precautions, checklists and consultations. Is the Democratic Party so resentful of Mr. Trump that it would deny innocent South Dakotans a Fourth of July celebration it is actively encouraging everywhere else just because he spoke there last year?",

            "description": "It's your last chance to see a supermoon this year with the 'strawberry' moon  CNN",
            "content": "Viewers will see a large golden (sorry, not strawberry-colored) moon for two to three nights, according to EarthSky\n\nThis supermoon becomes completely full at 2:40 p.m. ET on Thursday afternoon. It won't be fully visible in North America until later in the evening during \"moonrise,\" when the sun sets and the moon ascends into view. But viewers all over the world can see the strawberry moon, depending on where they are in respect to the horizon.\n\n\"The term 'supermoon' is much more recent and has come to be any full or new moon within 90% of its closest approach to Earth,\" wrote Christine Shupla, education and public engagement manager at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, in an email. \"By that definition, the full Moon on June 24 is also a supermoon, even though it is not as close as the full Moon was in May or April.\"\n\nSome stick to a stricter definition of supermoon, like Noah Petro, a lunar scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. For him, the only real supermoon is the one closest full moon of the year, which was last month's \"flower\" moon. Still, he acknowledged that others use the definition Shupla provided.\n\n\"That there is no standard definition is a bother, but anything that gets people interested and excited about looking at and wanting to know more about the Moon is a great thing!!!\" Petro wrote in an email.\n\nThe strawberry moon is the first of four full moons of the summer season. Its name, which originates from Indigenous peoples, refers to the ripening of strawberries and other fruits that occurs in late spring and early summer.\n\nMany tribes, however, have monikers for June's full moon that have nothing to do with fruit, including the Potawatomi tribe's \"msheke'kesis,\" or \"moon of the turtle\" and the Tlingit's \"at gadaxeet dis,\" or \"birth moon.\"\n\nTypical of a normal year, 2021 has 12 full moons. (There were 13 full moons last year, two of which were in October.)\n\nHere is what else you can look forward to in 2021.\n\nThe Delta Aquariids meteor shower is best seen from the southern tropics and will peak between July 28 and 29, when the moon is 74% full.\n\nInterestingly, another meteor shower peaks on the same night -- the Alpha Capricornids. Although this is a much weaker shower, it has been known to produce some bright fireballs during its peak. It will be visible for everyone, regardless of which side of the equator you are on.\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower, the most popular of the year, will peak between August 11 and 12 in the Northern Hemisphere, when the moon is only 13% full.\n\nNovember 19 will see a partial eclipse of the moon, and skywatchers in North America and Hawaii can view it between 1 a.m. ET and 7:06 a.m. ET.\n\nAnd the year will end with a total eclipse of the sun on December 4. It won't be visible in North America, but those in the Falkland Islands, the southern tip of Africa, Antarctica and southeastern Australia will be able to spot it.\n\nIt's possible to see most of these with the naked eye, with the exception of distant Neptune, but binoculars or a telescope will provide the best view.\n\nMercury will look like a bright star in the morning sky from June 27 to July 16 and October 18 to November 1. It will shine in the night sky from August 31 to September 21, and November 29 to December 31.\n\nVenus, our closest neighbor in the solar system, will appear in the western sky at dusk in the evenings through December 31. It's the second-brightest object in our sky, after the moon.\n\nMars makes its reddish appearance in the morning sky between November 24 and December 31, and it will be visible in the evening sky through August 22.\n\nJupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is the third-brightest object in our sky. It will be on display in the morning sky through August 19. Look for it in the evenings August 20 to December 31 -- but it will be at its brightest from August 8 to September 2.\n\nSaturn's rings are only visible through a telescope, but the planet itself can still be seen with the naked eye in the mornings through August 1 and in the evenings from August 2 to December 31. It will be at its brightest during the first four days of August.\n\nBinoculars or a telescope will help you spot the greenish glow of Uranus in the mornings through November 3 and in the evenings from November 4 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between August 28 and December 31.\n\nAnd our most distant neighbor in the solar system, Neptune, will be visible through a telescope in the mornings through September 13 and during the evenings September 14 to December 31. It will be at its brightest between July 19 and November 8.",

            "description": "Climate Emergency, Gen-Z Voices And Brand Activism  Forbes",
            "content": "The climate emergency is the defining challenge of our time. It can be easy to forget that temperatures are rising. The ice is melting, trees are burning and our oceans, filled with plastic. Gen-Z are remarkably aware of this reality: growing up with the existential risk of human extinction on their Instagram feeds. Young activists are no longer waiting for global leaders to take action. Instead, they are leading the fight against climate change.\n\nActivists are now the most important group for brands, even if they don\u2019t buy your product or service. Because a handful of digital activists can bring down share prices by convincing existing customers to boycott your brand. Historically, activism was viewed as something radical, often on the fringes of society. Today, activism is mainstream, further accelerated by the pandemic. In 2021, companies can no longer afford to stay silent on important social and environmental issues. Put simply, not taking a stand makes you complicit in maintaining the status quo. But greenwashing doesn\u2019t cut it either. Consumers are more informed and empowered than ever before. They can check if your words are backed by action via a quick Google search.\n\nAcross the globe, young activists are demanding immediate action from companies. The brands that don\u2019t listen will lose all credibility. Here are three ways you can future-proof your business by joining the climate movement.\n\nCheck yourself before you wreck yourself\n\nContrary to popular opinion, most Gen-Z activists don\u2019t blame ordinary consumers for their individual lifestyles. Many believe companies are shifting the blame to the end consumer instead of taking responsibility for their own supply chain. While we are all contributing to the climate emergency. The impacts of most of the world\u2019s people are minimal. Whereas multinational corporations are the biggest contributors to global greenhouse emissions. In fact, 100 companies are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions.\n\nYet most sustainability reports or marketing campaigns focus on marginal topics like plastic straws, reusable bags and recycling\u2014rather than addressing the root cause of the problem: overconsumption. If brands want to be seen as credible, dependable and responsible, they need to reshape all future brand communications and commitments to focus on their own responsibilities. Any attempt to shift responsibility to consumers will be called out and met with instant backlash, especially if contradictory to internal practices. Companies should accept their social and environmental footprint. Once this has been established, they can leverage social media to report progress, gain external feedback and build partnerships with grassroots organizations.\n\nFor young activists, climate justice is inseparable from social justice. In other words, we can\u2019t achieve climate justice without addressing historical and structural inequities. Without adopting an intersectional approach to the climate emergency, brands risk excluding the experiences of the global majority. Global inequality is baked into every aspect of modern society, including carbon emissions. The richest 1% of the world\u2019s population\u2014mostly in developed countries\u2014are responsible for more than twice the carbon pollution as the 3.1 billion people who make up the poorest 50% of humanity.\n\nAs a new generation of diverse activists takes center stage, the climate movement has become more intersectional. It would be unwise for purpose-driven companies to tackle environmental concerns while ignoring corresponding social issues. Brands can\u2019t claim to be sustainable if they\u2019re not equally invested in people. Activism means personal sacrifice. Many Gen-Z activists exchange financial gain, leisure time and even personal safety to improve the lives of others. Therefore, they expect global brands with enormous scale and resources to play their part too. And if they don\u2019t, they risk being canceled. Progressive brands have the opportunity to set up a dedicated fund to accelerate the impact of young activists already doing important work on the ground. But the program needs to be co-created, not performative. It needs to go beyond eurocentrism and include the unheard voices of indigenous communities and leaders.\n\nUnlike previous generations, Gen-Z demonstrate their activism through the medium of consumption. Young activists are fighting the system from within using their purchasing power. Often, this requires a level of personal sacrifice like not eating meat, sourcing eco-friendly alternatives and abandoning some of their favorite products. It reveals a clear, unmet consumer demand for more sustainable products and services. Brands should view sustainability as an unparalleled business opportunity, not a threat to their current profit and loss sheet.\n\nBut redirecting consumer spending is part of a wider strategy. Many young activists use social media to share their views and influence their network of friends, family and total strangers. This includes calling out brands that don\u2019t act responsibly and championing sustainable alternatives. However, the internet is not a one-way street, but a rich source of newfound knowledge and much-needed inspiration. Unlike the physical world, the internet is an oasis for like-minded consumer activists. A place for digital communities to connect, collaborate and challenge the status quo. Sustainable brands can equip young activists with the digital tools to divert attention, consumer spending and market share from less sustainable competitors.\n\nWith less than 100 days left until COP26, arguably, the most important summit ever. We have a historic opportunity to build a more sustainable future for all. This is not only about doing the right thing, but a business imperative. To quote Mark Carney, ex-Governor of the Bank of England: \u201ccompanies that fail to adapt to climate change will go bankrupt.\u201d Which side of history will your company be on?",
