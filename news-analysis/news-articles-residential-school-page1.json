            "content": "Casino mogul Rodney Baker and his wife, actor Ekaterina Baker, flew into a remote First Nation community in Yukon to get vaccinated. Photo via Facebook\n\nFormer casino mogul Rodney Baker, 55, and his wife Ekaterina Baker, a 32-year-old actor, flew into Whitehorse in January, where they chartered a private plane to take them 450 kilometres northwest to Beaver Creek, a community of approximately 100 people, most of whom belong to White River First Nation. In January, vaccines were scarce in Canada, and were prioritized for health care workers and some vulnerable communities, such as First Nations.\n\nOnce in the community, the couple misrepresented themselves to members of the mobile vaccination clinic, claiming to be employees of the local motel. After they received a dose of the Moderna vaccine they flew back to Whitehorse on their chartered plane.\n\nUnder Yukon\u2019s Civil Emergency Measures Act and as requested by both the Crown and Bakers\u2019 lawyers, the Bakers received the maximum fines but no jail time, for failing to isolate and failing to follow a travel declaration.\n\nThe couple made an appearance via video call Wednesday, Ekaterina in a white collared blouse next to Rodney in a black jacket and glasses. They sat stone-faced throughout the proceedings and said nothing when given the opportunity to address the court.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Rodney Baker was CEO of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation. The company, which owns 20 casinos across Canada, was already facing scrutiny in an inquiry into money laundering in British Columbia. When the vaccine case came to light, Baker resigned. His position netted him $10.6 million in salary and compensation in 2019.\n\nEkaterina Baker, an actor with minor roles in Fatman and Chickfight, had previously posted about the importance of social distancing and \u201cstaying home\u201d to protect \u201cthe community,\u201d including a short video in which she lists all the people she is staying home for through her Instagram account. The account has since been deactivated.\n\nCrown attorney Kelly McGill noted the couple\u2019s actions were clearly premeditated and involved \u201ca high level of deception,\u201d as Rodney had booked the charter flight and the couple had registered for the vaccine clinic before their arrival in the territory.\n\nCozens said mitigating factors in the case included the Bakers\u2019 quick, voluntary submission of COVID-19 tests following the charges, which came back negative. No one was infected as a result of the Baker\u2019s actions, although they inflicted \u201cpsychological\u201d harm on the community, Cozens said, likening the incident to someone being charged with drunk driving versus being charged with drunk driving causing bodily harm.\n\nJanet VanderMeer, White River\u2019s COVID-19 interagency team lead who read the statement, said the Bakers\u2019 actions had caused residents \u201canxiety and many sleepless nights,\u201d because it was unknown at the time if they were carrying the virus.\n\nVanderMeer said the Bakers were in the room with her and her 89-year-old mother\u2014who, like many of the older community residents, is a residential school survivor\u2014along with other elders while being vaccinated.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of White River Chief Bessie Chass\u00e9 afterwards, VanderMeer said Chass\u00e9 is \u201cjust glad it\u2019s done\u201d and believes the Bakers \u201cjust didn\u2019t have an understanding\u201d about her community and the impact of their actions. She was, however, \u201cdisappointed but not surprised\u201d by the submission of a joint deposition, which she described as the Yukon government \u201ctaking the easy way out.\u201d",

            "content": "NDP MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq rises in the House of Commons, in Ottawa, Thursday, May 13, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\n\nAbout a month after announcing she will not run for re-election, the MP for Nunavut, an Inuk woman, delivered a powerful farewell speech about the racism she\u2019s had to witness and endure while on the job.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that this institution and the country has been created off the backs, trauma, and displacement of Indigenous people,\u201d Mumilaaq Qaqqaq said. \u201cOur history is stained with blood.\u201d\n\nThe 27-year-old based in Iqaluit, Nunavut, is the first elected official to win the 40,000-person Nunavut riding under the left-leaning New Democrat Party banner since Nunavut was formalized as a territory in 1999.\n\nIn the 10-minute video, Qaqqaq details how Parliament security have profiled her, and how she\u2019s had to give herself pep talks in elevators, or take pause in bathroom stalls to maintain composure.\n\n\u201cEvery time I walk onto the House of Commons grounds, speak in these chambers, I'm reminded every step of the way I don't belong here. I have never felt safe or protected in my position,\u201d Qaqqaq said.\n\nShe then discussed how she and other Inuit have had to learn tactics to survive systemic racism and colonialism, something her experience as an elected official reinforced.\n\n\u201cMy life in Canada and especially through this experience has taught me many things: as a brown woman, do not move too quickly or suddenly, do not raise your voice, do not make a scene, maintain eye contact, and don't hide your hands,\u201d Qaqqaq said.\n\nHer speech comes after the remains of 215 undocumented Indigenous children were found under a former residential school. The news reiterated what Indigenous peoples have been saying for decades about the trauma and abuses they\u2019ve had to endure, again exposing how the government has repeatedly attempted to forcibly assimilate them.\n\nThe outgoing MP criticized the inaction of the federal government to address water and housing crises, forced displacement, and suicide in Indigenous communities across the country\u2014even calling out those in power who pay lip service to social justice without implementing change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many pretty words like reconciliation, diversity, and inclusion,\u201d Qaqqaq said. \u201cLet me be honest, brutally honest. Nice words with no action hurt when they are uttered by those with power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be easier for me to be told that I am wrong and that you disagree, than to be told that I am right and I'm courageous, but there is no room in your budget for basic, basic human rights,\u201d she said.\n\nQaqqaq also called out the federal government for \u201crefusing to care\u201d for the suicide epidemic plaguing Inuit, who have the highest suicide rates in the country. According to Statistics Canada, Inuit suicide rates are nine times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous people.\n\nQaqqaq has had to take leave from her duties as an MP twice, citing burnout and mental health after she went on a housing tour across Nunavut last fall. While she won\u2019t seek re-election, she previously said she will continue to advocate for Nunavut until her term ends, including by pushing for Indigenous languages on election ballots.\n\n\u201cAs long as these halls echo with empty promises instead of real action, I will not belong here,\u201d she said, before she voiced her support for the NDP.",

About a month after announcing she will not run for re-election, the MP for Nunavut, an Inuk woman, delivered a powerful farewell speech about the racism she\u2019s had to witness and endure while on the job.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that this institution and the country has been created off the backs, trauma, and displacement of Indigenous people,\u201d Mumilaaq Qaqqaq said. The news reiterated what Indigenous peoples have been saying for decades about the trauma and abuses they\u2019ve had to endure, again exposing how the government has repeatedly attempted to forcibly assimilate them.\n\nThe outgoing MP criticized the inaction of the federal government to address water and housing crises, forced displacement, and suicide in Indigenous communities across the country\u2014even calling out those in power who pay lip service to social justice without implementing change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many pretty words like reconciliation, diversity, and inclusion,\u201d Qaqqaq said. \u201cLet me be honest, brutally honest. According to Statistics Canada, Inuit suicide rates are nine times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous people.",

Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter.\n\n(CNN) US factories are feeling the squeeze of supply chain issues and materials shortages. As a result, manufacturers in June recorded the biggest price jump in 42 years.\n\nHere's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n\nThe House voted this week to create a select committee to investigate the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol -- and it's immediately become a politically fraught assignment. Republicans have made it clear they're not interested, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy even threatened to strip party members of other committee assignments if they accepted an offer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve. So far, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney has been tapped as one of the Democratic House speaker's committee picks. Cheney was previously removed from GOP House leadership after repeatedly criticizing ex-President Trump's false election claims. Meanwhile, new video from the insurrection is prompting more legal action against people who were there. The Justice Department this week rounded up several new defendants accused of destroying thousands of dollars' worth of professional broadcast equipment.\n\nRescue efforts at the Florida condo collapse site could face more challenges soon as a tropical storm approaches and risk of further collapse lingers . Work had to be halted for much of yesterday as engineers assessed the structure still standing. The rest of the building is expected to be demolished in coming weeks. Meanwhile, more ominous details from the years leading up to the collapse are coming to light. The building department in Surfside, Florida, was the target of mounting complaints by residents and contractors in late 2018 -- so much so that the town manager at the time placed the office under administrative review. A family suing the Champlain Towers South condo association also claims an engineering firm that performed a 2018 structural analysis on the building should have been more thorough\n\nThe Lower Kootenay Band, a member band of the Ktunaxa Nation, has announced the discovery of 182 human remains in unmarked graves at the site of another residential school in British Columbia. This site, near the city of Cranbrook, was formerly the St. Eugene's Mission School. This is the third boarding school where vast numbers of human remains have been identified. The discoveries have forced Canada to confront its history of systemic abuse of Indigenous communities, perpetuated in schools like these. The painful discoveries also led some Canadians to discourage celebrations during yesterday's Canada Day\n\nTHIS JUST IN ...\n\nAll US and coalition forces have left Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan\n\nWhat's safe to do over the 4th of July weekend?\n\nKrispy Kreme's second attempt on the public markets is much sweeter\n\nRichard Branson will try to beat Jeff Bezos to space\n\nVacation rental demand has gone crazy. Here's how you can still get a deal\n\nCelebrate the 4th of July by taking our quiz about American symbols!\n\nHere's one question to get you started: What is the national mammal of the United States?\n\n\"For many years the workplace environment at the Washington Football Team, both generally and particularly for women, was highly unprofessional.\"\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow",

It is a largely ceremonial role although the Queen must approve the appointment after seeking recommendations from the Canadian government.\n\n\"I am inspired by the historic nature of this moment, as our country continues to come to terms with the difficult realities of our collective past,\" , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Monday. \"I know that, as Canada's first Indigenous Governor General, Her Excellency will devote herself to helping us as we confront these difficult truths together, walk the shared path of reconciliation, and build bridges between all those who call our country home.\n\nAs first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) last year, current and former government employees accused Payette of creating a toxic workplace, harassing and bullying employees and reducing some employees to tears.\n\nThe appointment comes at a controversial time in Canada as the country confronts its history of systemic abuse of Indigenous communities, including forced assimilation programs. have recently been found in unmarked graves on the grounds of several former residential schools, leading to widespread outrage and criticism. Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission reported in 2015 that tens of thousands of indigenous children were neglected and abused in boarding schools they were forced to attend. have recently been found in unmarked graves on the grounds of several former residential schools, leading to widespread outrage and criticism.

Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission reported in 2015 that tens of thousands of indigenous children were neglected and abused in boarding schools they were forced to attend. 182 human remains discovered in unmarked graves near former residential school During her remarks earlier this month, Simon noted that as an Indigenous person, she understands the \"pain and suffering\" felt across the country. \"And as I said in my remarks, we need to stop to fully recognize and memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past that we are learning more about each day,\" Simon said, adding that it took \"courage\" for Trudeau to appoint her to the position. Simon was born in Kangiqsualujjuaq, Nunavik, and has served as an advocate for Inuit rights and culture, according to a Canadian government statement. She was actively involved in negotiations that led to the 1982 patriation of the Canadian Constitution that formally enshrined Aboriginal and treaty rights in the supreme law of Canada. Simon is also a former Canadian ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs, former ambassador to Denmark and past president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national Inuit organization. \"Ms. Simon has dedicated her life to advancing social, economic, and human rights issues for Canadian Inuit and Indigenous peoples, and I am confident that she will serve Canadians and promote our shared values with dedication and integrity,\" Trudeau said in a statement. As Simon takes on the role, she hopes she can be \"a bridge between the different lived realities that together make up the tapestry of Canada.\" \"I can relate to all people no matter where they live, what they hope for or what they need to overcome,\" she said.",

            "content": "With markers and a sheet of paper in hand, I call my special-needs son on the iPad and settle in for an hour of chatting and drawing. Framed by the small screen, 20-year-old Dylan directs the conversation and dictates the night\u2019s roster of shapes.\n\n\u201cHi Mommy, Y in the sky,\u201d he says, expecting me to respond \u201cT in the sky\u201d\u2014clearly mumbo-jumbo to outsiders, though it makes perfect sense to me. Dylan, who is severely impacted by autism, is referring to the shapes of the street lights he observes when we drive around town.\n\nThese nightly sessions have been the extent of our communications over much of the past year. The pandemic sent his residential school in Massachusetts into lockdown last March. By mid-July, he was able to come home again on weekends, but a spike in new cases in January led to a renewed lockdown and we were back to our virtual chats.\n\nDylan and I have always connected through our pictures. There are far better artists in the house, but only I am permitted by him to put pen to paper. The drawings have taken on a deeper meaning for both of us during the pandemic. Every few weeks I drop off a care package of his favorite snacks along with a few drawings. One of Dylan\u2019s teachers told me he keeps several on his desk at school. \u201cHe won\u2019t even let us touch the pictures \u2014 they\u2019re off limits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like his way of holding onto home and you two. Very beautiful.\u201d\n\nFor me, the calls are mentally exhausting because of Dylan\u2019s perseverative chatter, as he repeats the same words and phrases, day in and day out. He has a limited vocabulary and doesn\u2019t speak expressively. If I push him to talk to his twin brother Cameron, he\u2019ll both ask a question and answer it: \u201cHow are you? I\u2019m fine.\u201d Still, I have to see my boy and draw for him and I rarely miss a night. I\u2019d come to grips with our partial separation when he moved to the school three years ago , but when Covid cut off all access, it was almost too much to bear. We\u2019d never been apart longer than a week and I cringe a little every night when he asks me on screen for a \u201cmommy hug.\u201d\n\nTonight, we get down to business and Dylan gives me a run-down of my assignment. I\u2019m to draw purple hexagons, yellow stars, blue squares, two Barneys, two Elmos, a train and a bus. I\u2019m also mandated to write the color and name of each. I\u2019ve wondered how much he understands about the pandemic and figured not much, though he asks me to draw masks on the shapes.\n\nSince he refuses to draw himself, I make Dylan spell all the shapes as a way to redirect him from his repetitive banter. When done, I hold my creation up to the iPad. He must have inherited some of my editor genes because he carefully reviews and points out every mistake.\n\nDylan moved into the school in the summer of 2018, when he was 17. It was one of the most difficult times of my life. Of course, hindsight is 20/20, and after getting used to our new normal, I knew it had been the best possible decision and outcome. Dylan was thriving and happy, as long as he knew he\u2019d be home on weekends.\n\nOur family had been sinking into an abyss in the years prior. Autism encompasses so many challenges, and they vary from person to person, but common threads are difficulty communicating and regulating emotions. Dylan could be fine and smiling one moment and then burst into tears or an angry fit the next. As he got older and bigger, it became harder to manage his frustrations. He would lash out at his father and brother, who\u2019s also on the \u201cspectrum\u201d with high-functioning autism. At one point, Cameron told an aide at school that he didn\u2019t feel safe at home. That was the first of two turning points.\n\nI created a safety protocol. At times we could tell when Dylan\u2019s behavior was likely to escalate. I would yell out \u201cCode Red\u201d and his brother would lock himself in the nearest bathroom or bedroom. My husband would go to the basement and I would stay with Dylan, making sure he didn\u2019t hurt himself. He had hit me in the past, but rarely.\n\nWhen he flew into a rage, Dylan would scream \u201chitting Camy\u201d and \u201chitting Baba,\u201d which is father in Turkish. He would slam his bedroom door so often and so hard that the frame loosened from the wall. One time, he accidentally punched a hole in the door from inside his room. We still haven\u2019t replaced the door and two big metallic cardboard stars cover the hole.\n\nMy husband, a big, strong guy, fulfilled his Turkish military service in the 1980s commanding 40 soldiers on a remote post along the border with the Soviet Union. Months before we approached our school district about our situation, he said to me: \u201cI\u2019m a 60-year-old man, hiding behind furniture in the basement from my son.\u201d That was the second turning point.\n\nProbably from sheer exhaustion, Dylan would eventually give up and crumple into a heap of tears, slowly finding a path back to calm. We\u2019d lie on our backs in his darkened bedroom and stare at the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. And he\u2019d ask me to draw for him again\u2014mostly stars this time\u2014until he fell asleep.\n\nHelp in the form of a residential school\n\nFortunately the district agreed with our assessment that he needed more help and Dylan was approved for a residential placement. Massachusetts is known for its breadth of special needs services, but even so, demand can outpace supply. Somehow the stars aligned and a spot opened at an excellent program. A huge bonus: It was just 20 minutes away. That meant there would be continuity in Dylan\u2019s life and he could come home often.\n\nHe transitioned quickly and well, and got in the groove of daily trips into the community\u2014shopping, parks, movies. He got small jobs at school and then short shifts offsite with a job coach at organizations like Meals on Wheels and Mass Audubon.\n\nI, on the other hand, was a mess. For my husband and Cameron, Dylan\u2019s move brought a sense of relief. But I worried about his feelings. I had always been his champion, his advocate, his voice and I felt guilty not being able to care for him myself. I now had all this free time and didn\u2019t know what to do with it, so I hibernated for a few months.\n\nAs it became clear that Dylan was going to be fine and the structured program suited him, I climbed out of my funk. Cameron came out of his, too. When Dylan started coming home on weekends, his behavior improved and I stopped anticipating a meltdown. The visits revolved around ice skating, his one true passion, and, of course, drawing.\n\nWe reserved our coloring sessions mostly to the weekends, but that abruptly changed with the lockdown. Because of his limited ability to converse, I needed a way to keep him engaged on the iPad, so my drawing for him became a nightly routine. There are hundreds of pictures crammed in two drawers in our dining room. I\u2019ve saved every one of them. While I\u2019m drawing, we sing\u2014mostly nursery classics or theme songs from his favorite shows. Dylan changes a lyric now and then, his form of humor, and bursts into giggles.\n\nI\u2019ve learned a lot about my son during the pandemic. The biggest takeaway is how resilient he\u2019s proven to be, and that makes me proud. It goes without saying this would be impossible without the incredible school and residential staff who\u2019ve sacrificed their own wellbeing to take care of him and the others. Once a day Dylan would tell me \u201chome soon.\u201d When I said we\u2019re waiting for it to be safe, he\u2019d respond \u201cyes\u201d and move on.\n\nDylan got his second vaccine dose in March, and his latest lockdown ended recently\u2014 a year to the day when the first one began. We are reunited and drawing in person again. How nice it is to have him sitting next to me and I can follow through when he asks for a \u201cMommy hug.\u201d",

            "content": "\"It won't undo the heartbreak and loss we feel. But only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future that we're all proud to embrace,\" Sec. Deb Haaland said.\n\nThe US will search old federal boarding schools for the unmarked graves of Native American children, Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland said Tuesday, a project that will officially acknowledge the loss of life that has haunted tribal communities for more than 100 years. The announcement came at the National Congress of American Indians 2021 Mid Year Conference, where Haaland said the Department of Interior will prepare a detailed report using historical government records to identify possible burial sites. Between 1869 and the 1960s, more than 350 federal boarding schools forced thousands of Native American children from their parents to \"culturally assimilate\" them, and schools continued to operate in the decades after the government handed off control. Some children never returned home. \"I know that this process will be long and difficult,\" Haaland announced Tuesday. \"I know that this process will be painful. It won't undo the heartbreak and loss we feel. But only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future that we're all proud to embrace.\"\n\n The project was sparked after the remains of 215 children were found in March at a residential school in Canada, where a similar program removed children from their communities. An earlier Canadian government report on the residential schools described them as an act of \"cultural genocide.\" The children who were placed in the schools in the US and Canada were forcibly kept away from their parents, and abuse was rampant. The children's original language, culture, and customs were suppressed. In Canada, it's estimated that at least 4,000 and as many as 6,000 children died at school.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Post on June 11, Haaland wrote that news of the recent discovery of remains of the 215 Indigenous children in Canada made her \"sick to [her] stomach\" and noted that deaths \"were not limited to that side of the border.\" Haaland said that her own grandparents were taken from their parents as young children. \"They were only 8 years old and were forced to live away from their parents, culture and communities until they were 13,\" she wrote. \"Many children like them never made it back home.\" Haaland, a former US representative from New Mexico, is also the first Native American to head the Department of Interior and oversees federal lands and resources. She is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna. In an internal memo sent out at the Department of Interior, Haaland noted that the federal government oversaw boarding schools from 1819 through the 1960s under the Indian Civilization Act. The law separated families of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian descent. \"Many students endured routine injury and abuse,\" the memo reads. \"Some perished and were interred in unmarked graves. Survivors of the traumas of boarding school policies carried their memories into adulthood as they became the aunts and uncles, parents, and grandparents to subsequent generations.\" The Department of Interior ran the boarding schools for more than a century, the memo states, and therefore is \"uniquely positioned to assist in the effort to recover the histories of these institutions.\" \"We must shed light on what happened at federal Boarding Schools,\" Bryan Newland, principal deputy assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, said in a statement. \"As we move forward in this work, we will engage in Tribal consultation on how best to use this information, to protect burial sites, and respect families and communities.\" The project will include identifying records within the department documenting US boarding schools between 1819 to 1969, according to the memo. The department will also reach out to tribal nations, as well as Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian organizations, to help process and protect any burial sites that are identified. The review will include all records of enrollment, history, maps, and statistics of the schools, but the department noted that efforts should pay particular attention to any record that could point to cemeteries or any other burial site. A detailed report is expected to be completed by April 2, 2022.",

Between 1869 and the 1960s, more than 350 federal boarding schools forced thousands of Native American children from their parents to \"culturally assimilate\" them, and schools continued to operate in the decades after the government handed off control. In an internal memo sent out at the Department of Interior, Haaland noted that the federal government oversaw boarding schools from 1819 through the 1960s under the Indian Civilization Act. The project will include identifying records within the department documenting US boarding schools between 1819 to 1969, according to the memo.",

            "content": "There were shoes, poems, flowers, and teddy bears; people cycled through to pay their respects and read messages of support and calls to action. Indigenous people gathered with drums, in ribbon skirts and comforted each other. My partner said to me, \u201cseeing these cute, tiny little crocs and realizing they\u2019ll never be filled again is heartbreaking.\u201d That\u2019s the point.\n\nLast week\u2019s horrifying discovery has captured public attention, seemingly like never before, and many are inclined to believe things are finally going to change. But framing this as a wake-up call, or even stating that Canadians are paying attention and will act, is premature and overly optimistic: Canadians have had numerous chances to \"wake up,\u201d but haven\u2019t.\n\nIndian residential schools are sadly just a part of this country\u2019s horrific mistreatment of Indigenous people; from the youth suicide crisis in our communities, to the ' 60s scoop , to accessing clean drinking water , the list goes on. And these problems aren\u2019t just in remote communities far from urban centres where settler Canadians can pretend they aren\u2019t happening; Semiahmoo First Nation in B.C. recently had a 16-year boil water advisory lifted , after connecting to the nearby Metro Vancouver water line \u2014 the community is only five minutes from the city of White Rock. Does it not bother you that Indigenous people often face these kinds of conditions in a country that prides itself on multiculturalism and equality?\n\nThey \"woke up\" this past week expressing shock and disbelief, making their social media profile photos orange , putting on orange T-shirts and posting messages of solidarity. But as the news cycle dies down, I\u2019m inclined to believe so too will their support. The photos and posts will disappear and the collective national outrage will disappear with it. Each tragedy is an opportunity to act, to make change, to do better. But so far, Canada has failed to do just that. And the cycle continues.\n\nas the news broke, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was quick to encourage flags be put at half mast and say Even this past week,as the news broke, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was quick to encourage flags be put at half mast and say more support is coming , he has yet to announce a specific plan. Trudeau has pledged that the federal government will help preserve gravesites and uncover potentially more unmarked graves , but when the TRC requested $1.5 million to do that in 2009, the then-Harper government denied its request\n\nAs a mixed-Kanyen'keha:ka woman who works in media, these past several days have felt impossible. How can we continue life as normal when 215 of our people, our children, our community members' remains have been found? How can I juggle the needs of a newsroom with my desire to hit pause? How can I ask Indigenous people to write stories when I know they too need time to grieve?\n\nThere\u2019s this notion of the burden of responsibility, that responsibility to advocate for one's basic human rights often falls on those who are marginalized; we carry the weight. It\u2019s time settler-Canadians take some of this burden and make it their responsibility. How many will celebrate Canada Day while simultaneously condemning the mistreatment of Indigenous people? Actions need to line up with words, and this wake-up needs to be permanent.\n\nStart by reading the TRC 94 calls to action, think critically about how you can enact these actions in your own life, and about how changes can be made nationally; try contacting your MP . And if you have the means, follow up by donating to Indigenous organizations that support residential school survivors, and the work promoted by the TRC. From there, listen and witness.\n\nAnd for my Indigenous kin, I hope you find some time to grieve and take care of yourselves. I took one step towards this when I visited the Ottawa\u2019s memorial. Walking around the centennial flame I noticed these tiny, beautifully beaded blue moccasins. When I came across them, I was brought to tears. I pictured my family, community, and how so many Indigenous children never got the chance to keep walking in their moccasins. I held the tobacco tie I brought tight, took a moment, and placed it next to those blue moccasins.",

            "content": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the Roman Catholic Church has not offered a formal apology and made amends for its role in Canada\u2019s former system of church-run Indigenous boarding schools after the remains of 215 children were located at what was once the country\u2019s largest such institution.\n\nTrudeau called on the church to \u201cstep up\u201d and take responsibility after years of silence.\n\n\u201cAs a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position that the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to the Vatican a number of years ago I directly asked His Holiness, Pope Francis, to move forward on apologizing, on asking for forgiveness, on restitution, on making these records available, and we\u2019re still seeing resistance from the church, possibly from the church in Canada.\u201d\n\nBut Trudeau said the church is \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cnot stepping up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not showing the leadership that quite frankly is supposed to be at the core of our faith, of forgiveness, of responsibility, of acknowledging truth,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nHe said the government has \u201ctools\u201d it can use if the church itself doesn\u2019t release documents.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children in Canada were forced to attend state-funded Christian schools as an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. The Canadian government has admitted that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nTrudeau said Catholics across the country should reach out to bishops and cardinals on this issue.\n\n\u201cWe expect the church to step up and take responsibility for its role in this and be there to help with the grieving and healing including with records,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201dIt\u2019s something the United Church and others have done. It\u2019s something we are still waiting for the Catholic Church to do.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican spokesman did not respond to requests for comment this week about demands for a formal apology from the pope.\n\nFormer Pope Benedict met with a group of former students and victims in 2009 and told them of his \u201cpersonal anguish\u201d over their suffering, a meeting that was termed an expression of sadness and solidarity.\n\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops announced in 2018 that the pope could not personally apologize for residential schools, though he has not shied away from recognizing injustices faced by Indigenous people around the world.\n\nThe archbishop of Vancouver, however, apologized on Wednesday.\n\nThe United, Presbyterian and Anglican churches already have apologized for their roles in the abuse, as has the Canadian government, which has offered compensation.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia has said the remains of 215 children were confirmed last month at the school in Kamloops, British Columbia, with the help of ground-penetrating radar. So far none has been excavated.\n\nCasimir said her nation wants a public apology from the Catholic Church. She adds that the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which ran almost half of Canada\u2019s residential schools, has yet to release any records about the school.\n\nCasimir said the nation\u2019s findings are so far preliminary and she expects a final report, including technical details, will be ready by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThis is not a mass grave site but rather unmarked burial sites that are to our knowledge also undocumented,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential School was Canada\u2019s largest such facility and was operated by the Roman Catholic Church between 1890 and 1969. The federal government then ran it as a day school until 1978, when it was closed. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 schools were run by Catholic missionary congregations.\n\nA papal apology was one of the 94 recommendations made by a government-established Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Trudeau asked the pope to consider such a gesture during his visit to the Vatican in 2017.\n\nNelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said that in his rebuke, Trudeau didn\u2019t point out that residential schools were created and funded by the government. \u201cThe Catholic Church ran most of the schools but devoted few of its own resources to them beyond personnel paid for by the government,\u201d Wiseman said.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Welcome to Corridors. In this week\u2019s issue, another national reckoning, silly season in Parliament and impatience at the Canada-U.S. border.\n\n215 AND COUNTING \u2014 There were thoughts and prayers last evening as the House sat late for a \u201ctake-note\u201d debate five days after Kukpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir revealed that the remains of 215 Indigenous children had been identified by ground-penetrating radar in unmarked graves at a former residential school in the interior of British Columbia.\n\n\u201cCanadians are reeling in horror,\u201d NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said earlier in Question Period as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more and better to advance reconciliation with Canada\u2019s Indigenous peoples.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of transformative change,\u201d the prime minister told the House.\n\nOver in the Senate though, Sen. Mary Jane McCallum, a residential school survivor, was addressing her colleagues. \u201cOur hearts are broken,\u201d she said. \u201cCanada is broken.\"\n\nJune is National Indigenous History Month. This week, though, most stories on the Indigenous in Canada come with a trigger warning and a link to a residential school survivors\u2019 hotline.\n\nAfter the discovery in Kamloops made headlines around the world, a statue of Canada\u2019s first prime minister was removed overnight. Monuments across the country were circled with children\u2019s shoes and there were renewed calls to rename streets and schools and parks.\n\nMany Canadians declared themselves gutted by the discovery. Others pointed to Volume 4 of the recent report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada titled, \u201cMissing Children and Unmarked Burials.\u201d\n\nNDP MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq told MPs last night that expressions of shame and guilt, and the thoughts and prayers of non-Indigenous peoples won\u2019t create change. \u201cWhat Indigenous peoples are calling on throughout the country is [for] action \u2014 and for this to be treated as it is: it\u2019s a crime. What we are seeing is history, as one of the biggest crimes happening in Canada.\u201d\n\nKnown history: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified 6,000 deaths at Canada\u2019s residential schools, the last of which closed in 1996. Murray Sinclair, who led the inquiry, has suggested the number could be closer to 15,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another Kamloops coming,\u201d the Toronto Star reported Tuesday, but it was yesterday\u2019s news to those who have been paying attention. Here\u2019s the TRC\u2019s map of just some of Canada\u2019s residential schools.\n\n\u201cWho knows how many more children's bodies would be found, if we searched every single site?\u201d Qaqqaq asked. \u201cThis is not a discovery, but confirmation.\u201d\n\nThere has been a swell of grief and guilt across Canada, though it\u2019s not new territory. The obvious question now is what, if anything, will change.\n\nReporting from Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation for the Globe and Mail, Tanya Talaga asks, \u201cWhere is the list of the children\u2019s names? Why didn\u2019t the police investigate? What in God\u2019s name are they doing now?\u201d\n\nRelated reading: \n\n\u2014 Connie Walker and the first-hand legacy of residential schools.\n\n\u2014 Residential schools are not a footnote in Canada\u2019s history. They are its past and present.\n\n\u2014 Closing the gap in First Nations education.\n\n\u2014 Indigenous communities remember lost children.\n\nOntario\u2019s new chief medical officer of health will replace Dr. David Williams later this month. By way of introduction, the Globe\u2019s Patrick White notes that Moore, currently top doctor in Kingston and the region, \u201cis known for a mastery of disease surveillance, pandemic statistics and YouTube.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s down: The House of Commons health committee.\n\nHESA will meet later this afternoon to discuss scheduling through June. With luck, plans will include an end to filibustering, grandstanding and personal live-streams from within the hybrid committee room.\n\nCorridors is a new weekly newsletter for MPs, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\u2019s going on around Parliament Hill. Every Wednesday we will look at the people pulling the levers of power in Ottawa and the questions that are influencing decisions on Parliament Hill and in the provinces. Join the conversation! You can email us at [email protected], [email protected], [email protected], [email protected].\n\nGRANDSTANDING IN COMMITTEES \u2014 It\u2019s June and officially crunch time for parliamentarians to work together (or not) to get new laws passed committee study before the House and Senate adjourn for summer. The highest priority for the government is no doubt Bill C-30, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland\u2019s federal budget bill. Among its many spending provisions includes a proposal to extend the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy to Sept. 25.\n\nTwo government bills, if passed, would implement two of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s 94 calls to action. Bill C-5 seeks to establish a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation; and Bill C-15, modeled after former NDP MP Romeo Saganash\u2019s Bill C-262, would require the federal government to create a framework to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The former is likely to pass. The latter, which is under pre-study by a Senate committee, risks repeating the same fate of Saganash\u2019s bill when Conservative senators left it to die on the order paper in an election year.\n\nBackroom deals will likely have to be made to pass Bill C-12 after committee study revealed concerns about accountability gaps in the Liberals\u2019 marquee net-zero emissions legislation. Debate over Bill C-10, the government\u2019s legislation proposing sweeping changes to the Broadcasting Act, has forced the justice minister to address opposition concerns about free speech. Unless clause-by-clause committee study of the bill wraps soon, giving it the green light to proceed to the Senate, the legislation risks languishing in the House until MPs return from summer (or an election). As for Trudeau\u2019s privacy reform legislation (Bill C-11), it hasn\u2019t been referred to committee for study yet. It looks like it won\u2019t make it past the finish line.\n\nPrivate member\u2019s bills: Conservative MP Kevin Waugh\u2019s Bill C-218, which proposes updating the Criminal Code to legalize single-game sports betting, seems likely to pass.\n\nDebates over spilled milk: Bill C-216, sponsored by Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP Louis Plamondon, seeks to protect Canada\u2019s dairy sector by making concessions to the supply management illegal in future trade talks. People are talking about Canada\u2019s dairy quotas again after the Biden administration asked for a dispute settlement panel \u2014 the first under the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Briefs are due Monday for the House trade committee currently studying the bill \u2014 making its passage before summer break unlikely.\n\nBORDER PLAN? WHAT BORDER PLAN? \u2014 It\u2019s been no easy task digging up details on how and when authorities will start rolling back restrictions at U.S.-Canada land crossings. Insiders have kept tidbits of any \u201creopening\u201d strategy to a minimum, even as vaccination numbers climb, Covid cases decline and lawmakers on both sides start publicly pushing for a plan.\n\nEven senior provincial and state representatives have little info to offer on the way forward. U.S.-Canada talks are underway on an eventual road map \u2014 and the countries\u2019 agreement to keep the land border shut to nonessential travel expires June 21. Many folks have circled June 22 as the possible start date for a phase-in of looser rules.\n\n\u2014 The inside take: A Canadian government insider told POLITICO on Tuesday that the border reopening is \u201csomething that we\u2019re very consciously not talking about because it\u2019s not time yet to do that.\u201d Instead, the official said the government wants to keep people focused on finishing off the third wave and getting their Covid shots.\n\n\u2014 Tea leaves: Trudeau has said at least 75 percent of Canada\u2019s population should have their first Covid vaccine doses and 20 percent their second jabs before the country starts easing public health restrictions, including those at the border.\n\n\u2014 The squeeze: Trudeau\u2019s reluctance to go much further may come down to domestic pressures. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, for instance, has urged the prime minister to maintain border restrictions and the province of Manitoba has struggled to contain the latest wave of Covid-19. A poll released last week by Angus Reid Institute suggested 48 percent of people in the country supported keeping the border closed until September. The senior Canadian official said it would be wrong to assume there\u2019s some incredible pressure on the government and, even if there were, Ottawa would simply put health ahead of everything else.\n\n\u2014 How hockey fits in: Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that any government efforts to exempt National Hockey League players from restrictions at the border should also be channeled into reuniting families who have been kept apart by the pandemic measures. His request followed a report by The Canadian Press that talks are ongoing to create a travel exemption for teams during the NHL playoffs. Higgins was careful to stress that he\u2019s not opposed to any steps to allow hockey teams to cross the border. He also made an effort to boost his hockey credentials by noting he is a \u201cmember of the Congressional Hockey Caucus, played hockey as [a] kid and has laced up his skates in recent years for charity hockey events.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s top of your political podcast list? We asked the hosts of some of our favorites. Just for the record, three political podcast hosts we won\u2019t mention by name confessed they don\u2019t actually listen to any.\n\nFatima Syed, host of The Backbench: \u201cCanadian Politics is Boring.\u201d\n\nThe first time I listened to this podcast, which was created in lockdown, I was out for a walk and I had to sit down on a bench and stifle uncontrollable laughter so that the people around me didn't think I had lost my mind.\n\nIn every show, Rhys Waters, a new Canadian, tries to convince Jesse Harley, your average disengaged Canadian voter (not my words, but the podcast\u2019s), that Canadian politics is really interesting. In an effort to do this, Waters has shared stories about a UFO landing site in Alberta and American invasion plans for Canada that involved dropping poison gas in Halifax \u2014 things that don't normally get discussed in any Canadian politics or history class.\n\nCanadian politics can often be boring (sorry, but it's true), and these guys try really hard to make it fun (and interesting) by not taking it too seriously.\n\nMP Garnett Genuis, host of Resuming Debate: Well, of course, I would recommend Resuming Debate, which is always interesting and substantive and brings a strong diversity of thoughtful voices.\n\nThe Blueprint is a great source of information, sharing what Conservatives in particular are up to.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t often agree with him, I enjoy listening to Uncommons with Nate Erskine-Smith, as a way to understand what people on the other side are thinking and saying.\n\nScott Reid, panelist on The Herle Burly podcast: Hacks on Tap with David Axelrod and Mike Murphy on Apple Podcasts is so accomplished that you might call it the American Herle Burly. Axelrod is smart. Murphy is hilarious. And, best of all, they both loathe Trump. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nEverything from Connie Walker is remarkable. Her latest podcast Stolen: The Search for Jermain | Gimlet (gimletmedia.com) is a heartbreaking story about one missing Indigenous woman who hasn\u2019t gone unmissed. If you don\u2019t think this podcast is about politics you\u2019re not paying attention.\n\nWriting in the Globe on Bill 96, Eddie Goldenberg, who served as chief of staff to Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, advises the PM: \u201cSlam the constitutional door shut now before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe Globe\u2019s Jeff Gray and Laura Stone noted Ontario Premier Doug Ford\u2019s change of tactics. The focus now? The next election.\n\nIn a related column, The Star\u2019s Chantal Hebert considers the plight of Canada\u2019s Conservative premiers and asks if current pandemic polling is a symptom of a larger more systemic malaise within the Canadian right.\n\nCalgary has a 10-year, C$1-billion plan to improve its downtown where a third of office towers are vacant. The proposal calls for transforming some office space into housing. Drew Anderson of the CBC considers the complex gamble and asks: \u201cWho owns Calgary's downtown and why should public dollars be used to incentivize a change in corporate business plans? To what end?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Any border exemptions for NHL players should extend to divided families.\n\n\u2014 The other digital tax, from Brussels with love.\n\n\u2014 Privacy czar: Trudeau's privacy reform may not survive.\n\n\u2014 Biden administration sides with Florida on Canadian drug imports.\n\n\u2014 Canadian minister disputes USTR\u2019s account of lumber talks.\n\nSpotted: A Twitter account dubbed \u201cSpeaker of Truth\u201d created a stir over the weekend posting unverified rumors about work conditions inside the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The account has since been deleted. A government source confirmed to POLITICO the PMO held a meeting Monday, one that was previously scheduled, where HR processes were discussed in part due to the rumors circulating online.\n\nOver in the Senate, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc said he expects the government to announce the next governor general before the end of the month.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna colored her own hair (green!) \u2014 but not without industry blowback.\n\nBirthdays: HBD to Sen. Howard Wetston, 74 on Thursday. That\u2019s the same day Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre turns 42 \u2026 Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen will be 46 on June 5, MP Ramesh Sangha will be 76 on June 6, the same day Liberal MP Francis Scarpaleggia is 64. \u2026 Green MP Liz May will be 67 and Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault will be 51 on June 9.\n\nMedia mentions: Broadcaster Terry DiMonte, a personal friend of Trudeau\u2019s, has left the CHOM airwaves. He was recognized in the House for shaping the sense Montrealers have of themselves. \u2026 Todd Lamirande has signed off as host of APTN\u2019s Nation to Nation. \u2026 Trina Roache has left APTN to teach journalism at King\u2019s College. \u2026 Aidan Chamandy is at work at iPolitics. \u2026 Chantelle Lee is on the national desk at the Globe this summer. \u2026 Michael Den Tandt will soon join the Centre for International Governance Innovation as managing editor.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Journalists\u2019 Charles Bury Award is given to those who have made a significant contribution to Canadian journalism. This year\u2019s recipients are journalist and teacher David McKie and journalist and professor Fred Vallance-Jones.\n\nThe rest of the CAJ winners are here.\n\nFarewells: NDP MP Richard Cannings paid tribute in the House to John Lounds, who retires from the Nature Conservancy of Canada this year. \u201cJohn Lounds is a champion. He inspires others to dream of what Canada and the earth can be if we put nature first,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week first: The Abstract Expressionist Gallery at the National Gallery of Canada will be renamed the Dr. Shirley L. Thomson Gallery. During Thomson\u2019s decade as director, the gallery acquired Barnett Newman's Voice of Fire and Mark Rothko's No. 16. It also exhibited Jana Sterbak's Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic.\n\nThis week\u2019s question: During this week in 1979, the first woman was appointed to serve as Canada\u2019s Secretary of State for External Affairs. Name that MP.\n\nWith thanks to editor John Yearwood.",

            "content": "The federal government will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools and work to \"uncover the truth about the loss of human life and the lasting consequences\" of policies that over the decades forced hundreds of thousands of children from their families and communities, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced Tuesday.\n\nThe unprecedented work will include compiling and reviewing records to identify past boarding schools, locate known and possible burial sites at or near those schools, and uncover the names and tribal affiliations of students, she said.\n\n\"To address the intergenerational impact of Indian boarding schools and to promote spiritual and emotional healing in our communities, we must shed light on the unspoken traumas of the past no matter how hard it will be,\" Haaland said.\n\nA member of New Mexico\u2019s Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, Haaland outlined the initiative while addressing members of the National Congress of American Indians during the group\u2019s midyear conference.\n\nShe said the process will be long, difficult and painful and will not undo the heartbreak and loss endured by many families.\n\nStarting with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the U.S. enacted laws and policies to establish and support Indian boarding schools across the nation. For over 150 years, Indigenous children were taken from their communities and forced into boarding schools that focused on assimilation.\n\nHaaland talked about the federal government's attempt to wipe out tribal identity, language and culture and how that past has continued to manifest itself through long-standing trauma, cycles of violence and abuse, premature deaths, mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\nThe recent discovery of children's remains buried at the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school has magnified interest in the troubling legacy both in Canada and the United States.\n\nUS TO GIVE ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO SKIPPED COURT DATE ANOTHER SHOT\n\nIn Canada, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and were not allowed to speak their languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nAfter reading about the unmarked graves in Canada, Haaland recounted her own family's story in a recent opinion piece published by the Washington Post.\n\nHaaland cited statistics from the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which reported that by 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children were attending boarding schools that were run either by the federal government or religious organizations. Besides providing resources and raising awareness, the coalition has been working to compile additional research on U.S. boarding schools and deaths that many say is sorely lacking.\n\nFLORIDA WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO TEACH CIVICS AND \u2018EVILS OF COMMUNISM\u2019\n\nInterior Department officials said aside from trying to shed more light on the loss of life at the boarding schools, they will be working to protect burial sites associated with the schools and will consult with tribes on how best to do that while respecting families and communities.\n\nAs part of the initiative, a final report from agency staff is due by April 1, 2022.\n\nChuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, which had about 80 boarding schools, called the announcement encouraging and said anything that can be done to address those \"troubling chapters of history\" is a positive thing.\n\n\"I hope we don\u2019t discover gruesome incidents like were discovered in Canada. I just think it\u2019s good in this country to have conversations about what happened to Native American children,\" Hoskin said.\n\nJOSH HAWLEY BLASTS CRITICAL RACE THEORY AS BIDEN ADMIN'S \u2018ANIMATING IDEOLOGY\u2019 AS HE OPPOSES OPM NOMINEE\n\nNavajo Nation President Nez also offered his support for the initiative, noting discrimination against Native Americans continues today on many fronts \u2014 from voter suppression to high numbers of missing and murdered people.\n\n\"Last week, Congress and President Biden established \u2018Juneteenth\u2019 as a national holiday, in observance of the end of slavery, which I fully support as a means to healing the African American community,\" Nez said. \"Now, from my perspective as a Navajo person, there are so many atrocities and injustices that have been inflicted upon Native Americans dating back hundreds of years to the present day that also require national attention, so that the American society in general is more knowledgeable and capable of understanding the challenges that we face today.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the federal government has attempted to acknowledge what Haaland referred to as a \"dark history.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore than two decades ago, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Kevin Gover issued an apology for the emotional, psychological, physical and spiritual violence committed against children at the off-reservation schools. Then in 2009, President Barack Obama quietly signed off on an apology of sorts that was buried deep in a multibillion-dollar defense spending bill; the language had been watered down from the original legislation introduced years earlier.",

Pope Francis has expressed sorrow over the discovery in Canada of the remains of 215 boarding school students but didn't offer the apology sought by the Canadian prime minister. Francis in public remarks on Sunday called on political and church authorities to work to shed light \u201con this sad affair\u201d and to foster healing. (AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Sunday expressed his pain over the discovery in Canada of the remains of 215 Indigenous students of church-run residential schools and pressed religious and political authorities to shed light on \u201cthis sad affair.\u201d But he didn\u2019t offer the apology sought by the Canadian prime minister.\n\nFrancis, in remarks to faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square, also called on the authorities to foster healing but made no reference to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s insistence, two days earlier, that the Vatican apologize and take responsibility.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian schools, the majority of them run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, in a campaign to assimilate them into Canadian society.\n\nThe Canadian government has admitted that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nGround-penetrating radar was used to confirm the remains of the children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Kamloops, British Columbia, last month. The school was Canada\u2019s largest such facility and was operated by the Catholic Church between 1890 and 1969.\n\n\u201cI am following with pain the news that arrives from Canada about the upsetting discovery of the remains of 215 children,\u201d Francis said in his customary Sunday noon remarks to the public.\n\n\u201cI join with the Canadian bishops and the entire Catholic Church in Canada in expressing my closeness to the Canadian people traumatized by the shocking news,\u2033 Francis said.\n\n\u201dThis sad discovery adds to the awareness of the sorrows and sufferings of the past,\u201d he added.\n\nTrudeau on Friday blasted the church for being \u201csilent\u201d and \u201cnot stepping up,\u2033 and called on it to formally apologize and to make amends for its prominent role in his nation\u2019s former system of church-run Indigenous residential schools.\n\nHe noted that when he met with Francis at the Vatican in 2017, he had asked him to \u201dmove forward on apologizing\u201d and on making records available. But, Trudeau said, \u201cwe\u2019re still seeing resistance from the church, possibly from the church in Canada.\u201d\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia has said her nation wants a public apology from the Catholic Church. The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which ran nearly half of Canada\u2019s residential schools, has yet to release any records about the Kamloops school, she also said.\n\nFrancis\u2019 comments spoke of healing but not of apology.\n\n\u201cMay the political and religious authorities continue to collaborate with determination to shed light on this sad affair and to commit humbly to a path of reconciliation and healing,\u2033 Francis said.\n\n\u201cThese difficult moments represent a strong call to distance ourselves from the colonial model and from today\u2019s ideological colonizing and to walk side by side in dialogue, in mutual respect and in recognizing rights and cultural values of all the daughters and sons of Canada,\u201d the pope said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s entrust to the Lord the souls of all those children, deceased in the residential schools of Canada,\u2033 the pontiff added. \u201cLet us pray for the families and for the indigenous Canadian communities overcome by sorrow.\u201d Francis then asked the public in the square below his window to join him in silent prayer.\n\nLast week, the Vatican spokesman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the demands for a formal apology from the pope.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vancouver Archbishop Michael Miller tweeted his \u201cdeep apology and profound condolences to the families and communities that have been devastated by this horrific news.\u201d The churchman, who leads Catholics in that British Columbia archdiocese, added that the church was \u201cunquestionably wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for children, families and communities.\u201d\n\nThe United, Presbyterian and Anglican churches have apologized for their roles in the abuse, as has the Canadian government, which has offered compensation.\n\nAmong the many recommendations of a government-established Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a papal apology.\n\nIn 2009, then Pope Benedict XVI met with former students and survivors and told them of his \u201cpersonal anguish\u201d over their suffering. But his words weren\u2019t described as an apology.",

            "description": "How Canadian Filmmaker Lisa Jackson Plans to Weave Wilfred Buck\u2019s Wild Ride \u2018From the Gutter to the Stars\u2019 With Indigenous Astronomy Lore  Variety",
            "content": "Lisa Jackson\u2019s hybrid documentary feature project \u201cWilfred Buck,\u201d which centers on the eponymous science facilitator, an expert in Indigenous lore about astronomy, won the Canadian Forum Pitch Prize at Hot Docs last week. Jackson tells Variety how she came to the project.\n\nJackson \u2013 whose mother was Anishinaabe, an Indigenous group in North America \u2013 was at a conference in November 2017 when she first heard about Wilfred Buck, who had curated an exhibit at the Canada Science and Technology Museum based on the stories about the stars told by First Nations communities. As well as being an educator, Buck is an elder and ceremonial leader for the Cree, one of Canada\u2019s largest First Nations groups.\n\nWhen she heard about Buck\u2019s work, Jackson had what she describes as a \u201czap\u201d \u2013 an urgent realization that \u201csomeone has to make a film on this man,\u201d she recalls.\n\nWhen she contacted Buck, he told her that he had just written his life story, and he emailed it to her. As Jackson puts it in her Hot Docs pitch, Buck\u2019s \u201cjourney had taken him from the gutter to the stars.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, Buck\u2019s family was forced off their land in Northern Manitoba, which was flooded to make way for a hydro-electric dam. He grew up in a nearby town in poverty. The first time he tasted alcohol he drank until he blacked out, he writes in his memoirs. \u201cAfter that I walked into the darkness and never looked back.\u201d\n\nHe became homeless, battling his demons. In 1983, when he went into treatment for the 20th time, he met a Cree elder. \u201cAfter what she shared, I saw the world in a totally different way. It seemed like a bright light was turned on in my dark universe,\u201d he says. \u201cI found a peace that was missing from my life.\u201d\n\nJackson says of his autobiography, \u201cFrom the first page, that was the clincher for me. The voice that he wrote in reminded me of Jack Kerouac, or the Beat poets. It was just such an incredible voice.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI could see already the possibility to do a hybrid documentary that looked at his work now and also brought to life, in a kind of poetic way, his background.\u201d\n\nBy this time, Jackson \u2013 who is Toronto based \u2013 had got in touch with Alicia Smith, a producer at Canada\u2019s National Film Board, who is based in Winnipeg, as is Buck. She was also intrigued about Buck\u2019s story, and interested in coming on board, alongside Jackson\u2019s Door Number 3 Productions.\n\nIn spring 2018, Jackson flew to Winnipeg and met with Buck, requesting that she be allowed to make a film about his life. \u201cHis response was, \u2018Okay, well, why don\u2019t you come to the ceremony I lead every summer, the Sundance in Northern Manitoba, a four-day event. And we\u2019ll talk after that,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nSo, several months later, Jackson and Smith headed to Northern Manitoba for the ceremony, which Jackson describes as \u201can incredible experience,\u201d which gave them a \u201cdeeper sense of connection about who he was, and his culture, the traditions.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Buck granted his permission, and Jackson and Smith have been in development ever since. About a year ago, filmmakers Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier of Mercury Films joined the project as executive producers. As well as the National Film Board of Canada, the film is supported by Sundance Sandbox funding, Bell Media\u2019s Crave, Canada Media Fund, and the Indigenous Screen Office.\n\nThe film will incorporate three strands. The first, using archival footage and re-enactments, will bring \u201cto life Wilfred\u2019s past, as written in his autobiography, set to narration with a rock and roll [soundtrack],\u201d Jackson says. \u201cWhat drew me to him was the star knowledge. What I was completely captivated by was this kind of Hunter S. Thompson wild ride he had.\u201d\n\nThe second strand will be v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage documenting his life now as an educator, Cree elder and ceremonial leader. Buck is much in demand by Western educational and scientific institutions, such as MIT, wishing to bring his Indigenous star knowledge into its work on astronomy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in connecting with him, potentially collaborating, on putting together something to go up in a space mission, or otherwise bringing Wilfred and the star knowledge perspective into the space conversation, particularly in space exploration,\u201d Jackson says. As commercial entities become increasingly active in space exploration, issues relating to the colonization of space are becoming part of the conversation, underscoring the need for other voices \u2013 such as Buck\u2019s \u2013 to counterbalance these perspectives.\n\nThe third strand of the documentary will bring \u201cin a poetic way, like a Greek chorus, stories of the stars themselves,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll be largely focused on Indigenous, especially Cree star knowledge stories, which can range from a creation story about the first woman who came down from the sky world, but it also has to do with the way stars are really integral to how people navigated and managed the seasons.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI want to bring in the perspective of star knowledge through a scientific lens, but told somewhat poetically.\u201d This strand will be voiced in the Cree language.\n\nJackson aims to complete the documentary by July 2022.\n\nAmong her other projects is an animation called \u201cMush Hole,\u201d which she is producing with Lauren Grant. Based on true events in the 1940s, the film follows two sisters who must adapt to residential school and are torn apart when one becomes a model student and the other a rebel. A mass runaway in the dead of winter brings events to a head and the sisters realize that only by helping each other will they escape.\n\n\u201cMush Hole,\u201d which is supported by Telefilm Canada, Harold Greenberg Fund, and the Indigenous Screen Office, was developed as part of Toronto Intl. Film Festival\u2019s Writers Studio and ACE Producers Lab.",

            "description": "'Islamophobia is real.' Trudeau attends vigil for Muslim family killed in targeted attack  Politico",
            "content": "Leaders from all levels of government attended the vigil, and listened to members of the city\u2019s Muslim community express frustration over the lack of action to address Islamophobia.\n\nMustafa Farooq, chief executive officer of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, urged all levels of government to organize a national summit on Islamophobia. Trudeau and his federal counterparts each took turns addressing the crowd, and expressed solidarity in their grief.\n\nEarlier in the House of Commons, Trudeau called the killings \u201ca terrorist attack.\u201d Four years ago, he delivered a similar speech from the same spot after a mass shooting at a Quebec City mosque left six men dead and 19 injured.\n\n\u201cSuch an act of violence has no place in Canadian society,\u201d the prime minister said at the time.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Canada\u2019s first non-white leader of a federal party, told the Commons on Tuesday that he used to lived in the city where the attack took place. \u201cI love my home. I love this place,\u201d he read into the official record. \u201cBut the reality is this is our Canada.\u201d\n\nInternational headlines in recent weeks have eroded Canada\u2019s reputation as a tolerant society.\n\nLast month, the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation announced the discovery of the remains of 215 children in the grounds of a former residential school in Kamloops, a city in the western province of British Columbia. It\u2019s a piece of Canada\u2019s history, too, Singh reminded viewers.\n\n\u201cOur Canada is a place where 215 little kids were found dead in unmarked graves. Our Canada is a place where you can\u2019t walk down our streets if you wear a hijab because you will be killed!\u201d the NDP leader said.\n\n\u201cThis is our Canada. We can\u2019t deny it. We can\u2019t reject that because it does no one any help,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe reality is our Canada is a place of racism, of violence, of genocide of Indigenous people, and our Canada is a place where Muslims aren\u2019t safe.\u201d\n\nIslamophobia has increased online which has resulted in more incidents of anti-Muslim harassment and violence during the pandemic, according to the Muslim Association of Canada\u2019s Khaled Al-Qazzaz.\n\nCanada does not have a national definition for what is considered a hate crime. The country does not formally collect national statistics tracking Islamophobia because the definition of hate-motivated crime varies between police forces. This is increasingly complicated because the national statistics agency tracks police-reported crimes by types of motivation (race, religion, sexual orientation and language), but the information is not disaggregated. Organizations have long raised concerns about this because they are unable to receive government funding to support their communities without pointing to hard data.\n\nWith a potential federal election on the horizon, Singh then focused on the state of political discourse and pointed to Sunday\u2019s attack as another example of why \u201cNo one can ever use Islamophobia for a political gain.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is what happens when you divide people\u2019\n\nSunday\u2019s attack has invited some reflection on Bill 21, Quebec\u2019s controversial secularism law introduced by the province\u2019s nationalist Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government. The law prohibits judges, police officers, teachers and public servants from wearing religious symbols at work. The bill faces a court challenge following concerns raised by civil rights and religious groups that it disproportionately impacts Muslim women.\n\nThe voting record on M-103, a non-binding motion introduced by a Liberal MP in 2017, has also been revisited in recent days. Among its provisions, it asked federal politicians to \u201ccondemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.\u201d\n\nTrudeau was not in the House of Commons and abstained from that vote in 2017. Conservative MP (now leader) Erin O\u2019Toole said the motion \u201cdid not come from a genuine desire to have a serious debate on discrimination in the House of Commons\u201d and voted against it. Singh was not in federal office at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s solely those politicians who have used Islamophobia for political gain who are to blame. Absolutely not,\u201d Singh said. \u201cBut you are surely a part of the problem.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister was pressed Tuesday about the renewed focus on M-103.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to start looking to the past, and pointing out too much, well, this party did this and that party did that. I think today we need to look forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to recognize mistakes made from the past, learn from them and be resolute on demonstrating that the kind of hatred that in this case gave rise to such horrific tragedy is not encouraged even accidentally.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister scrapped plans to attend a donor appreciation event to instead attend the London mosque\u2019s evening vigil for the family.\n\nTrudeau and O\u2019Toole traveled from Ottawa to London together to attend the vigil, O\u2019Toole\u2019s spokesperson Josie Sabotino told POLITICO.\n\nA senior source told POLITICO that Singh traveled to the vigil separately.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s description of the incident as a terrorist attack draws attention on the possibility the national Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) could lay a terrorism charge in the case.\n\nBut the prime minister's condemnation of a violent incident as a terrorist attack doesn\u2019t mean Canada\u2019s legal system views the alleged crime the same way. Trudeau called the Quebec City mosque shooting a terrorist attack in 2017, but police did not lay terrorism charges against the gunman, Alexandre Bissonnette.\n\nLondon police arrested a 20-year-old man in a parking lot wearing a \u201cbody armour-like\u201d vest Sunday. The suspect has since been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.\n\nFew details about the driver have been reported and the investigation is ongoing. London Police Service Chief Stephen Williams has confirmed officers are in talks with RCMP and a terrorism charge is a possibility that\u2019s on the table.\n\nThe attack in Canada has some American groups looking to President Biden for leadership after an alleged hate-motivated attack that targeted a Muslim family north of the border.\n\nPresident Biden must condemn the \u201cgrowing phenomenon of global Islamophobia\u201d after Sunday\u2019s attack, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement Tuesday. The organization asked the president to appoint a special envoy to monitor and combat Islamophobia.",

            "description": "At University of Minnesota Morris campus, students demand search for Indian boarding school victims  Minneapolis Star Tribune",
            "content": "A statue of an Anishinaabe grandmother stands about 8 feet tall in the heart of the University of Minnesota Morris campus. A small boy wearing an American Indian boarding school uniform clutches the grandmother's side while a little girl hides behind her, showing her reluctance to join the boy at the school.\n\nThe sculpture was installed in 2018 as a reminder of this site's dark history. Decades before the U's Morris campus opened in 1960, a boarding school that separated Native American children from their families and tried to forcibly assimilate them into white culture stood in its place.\n\nSome of the children who attended the boarding school died there, and research suggests it is possible they were buried on or near what is now the Morris campus.\n\nRecent discoveries of mass graves at former boarding school sites in Canada have prompted Native American students at the Morris campus to demand a search at their school. More than 4,000 people signed a student-led petition this month in support of a Morris campus search, which they say is an essential step for the university to confront and heal from its history.\n\n\"It's a burden \u2014 emotionally, mentally, spiritually,\" Dylan Young, co-chair of the university's Circle of Nations Indigenous Association, said of learning at a campus where children might be buried. \"This is something that the university has to confront.\"\n\nMorris leaders say they do not shy away from their campus' history. The university has publicly acknowledged it, held ceremonies centered on truth telling and healing and recently joined the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition. But administrators are not yet committing to search the campus because questions remain about the graves' whereabouts and existence.\n\n\"I think this is a very difficult issue for everyone involved,\" said Janet Schrunk Ericksen, acting chancellor of the U's Morris campus. \"It is an issue that we want to handle with as much compassion and as much collaboration as we can.\"\n\nThe discussion in Morris coincides with growing national awareness of the trauma inflicted during the boarding school era. After the discovery of 215 unmarked graves at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Canada, U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced in June a federal investigation into possible student burial sites at or near the locations where American Indian boarding schools operated.\n\nThe Morris boarding school was one of 16 that operated in Minnesota and among hundreds in the U.S. It was founded in 1887 by the Sisters of Mercy community of the Catholic Church, who ran the school for a decade until the federal government took over operations.\n\nTribes regularly objected to some of the Morris boarding school's practices, which included extending students' terms, refusing to release them for vacation and sending staff to forcibly bring back students who left, according to research archived by the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nAfter the federal government took control of the school, there were accusations that staff, and even the superintendent, sexually abused some of the children.\n\nThe government closed the school in 1909 and transferred ownership of its campus and buildings to the state of Minnesota with the stipulation that Native American students be admitted tuition-free into future educational institutions built there. That policy is still honored today by the University of Minnesota Morris, the only U campus to offer tuition waivers to Native American students.\n\nIn 2018, archival research conducted by Morris students and faculty suggested that between three and seven children who died at the boarding school may have been buried on or near the present-day campus. They found no documentation that the children's remains were returned to their parents.\n\nHowever, follow-up research from other students and faculty did not find evidence that such graves existed, according to the university. As a result, Morris administrators are not certain a cemetery exists. If it does, they have not been able to determine its location or whether any remains are still buried there.\n\nStudents and tribal leaders say the university has a responsibility to find out. The petition created by two Native American students, Young and fellow Circle of Nations Indigenous Association co-chair Claudia Iron Hawk, calls on the university to hire an Indigenous ground-penetrating radar specialist to search the grounds for unmarked graves. That technology was used to discover the graves in Canada.\n\nInstead of waiting for the U.S. Interior Department's investigation, which Morris leaders have said they will comply with, Iron Hawk said the university should take the lead on a potential search in collaboration with tribal nations.\n\n\"That would take \u2026 the emotional burden off of Native students who are mainly here to get a degree and not have to also face intergenerational trauma,\" Iron Hawk said.\n\nShannon Geshick, executive director of the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council, said she also thinks the university should search its campus \u2014 if that is what the affected tribes want.\n\nThe university has contacted those most impacted by the boarding school, including the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, about working together on the issue moving forward, Ericksen said. No meetings have occurred yet. \"We want to make sure that when we do it, they want us to do it,\" Ericksen said of a potential search.\n\nIt is a process that will take time to do right, administrators say. Sandra Olson-Loy, Morris' vice chancellor for student affairs, noted that Canada has been reckoning with its boarding school history for more than a decade. A \"truth and reconciliation\" commission it established in 2008 cataloged evidence for years before new technology was used to find the burial sites.\n\nIn the meantime, university leaders will continue research into the school's past and discussions with students and employees. The university will hold its third annual truth telling and healing ceremony in November.\n\n\"We really would welcome the chance to ... be a model for how truth telling and greater understanding can happen,\" Olson-Loy said.\n\nJulia Scovil, undergraduate student body president at the Morris campus, said the university will eventually need to move beyond public statements and healing ceremonies.\n\n\"If Morris doesn't search the school, I think that all of those past actions and words have really been done in vain,\" Scovil said.",

REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt\n\nJune 22 (Reuters) - Clarence Smith was fresh off a 24-hour bus trip from his Blackfeet reservation in Montana to the Flandreau Indian School in South Dakota in the late 1980s, where he was sent by his family in the hope he would receive a better education.\n\n\"On one of the first days of class, a white social studies teacher stood before our class and told us that we were lucky Columbus had found us, because otherwise we would still be living in teepees,\" Smith said.\n\nHe gazed down at the pair of LA Lakers sneakers he got just for his new school. If it weren't for Columbus, he would still be in moccasins, he recalls thinking. Many years would pass before Smith began reeducating himself, as he puts it - of finding his own history.\n\nFlandreau, which declined comment, is one of at least 73 Native American schools out of an original 367 still in operation across the United States, according to researchers at the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nOne academic researcher contends that as many as 40,000 children may have died in or because of their poor care at the U.S.-run schools, but the federal government does not know or is unwilling to say how many children even attended the schools, how many died in or went missing from them, or even how many schools existed.\n\nAs a congresswoman representing New Mexico, Deb Haaland was among those who called for a commission to fully investigate the legacy of Indian boarding schools. On Tuesday in her new position as U.S. Interior Secretary, Haaland announced that her department would investigate the schools and their lasting impact on the lives of Native Americans. read more\n\nThe investigation will focus on children who died while attending the schools and on finding their unmarked graves. The department will gather as complete a record as possible on the schools, where they were located and who attended them.\n\n\"I know that this process will be painful and won't undo the heartbreak and loss that so many of us feel,\" Haaland said in remarks to the National Congress of American Indians. \"But only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future that we're all proud to embrace.\"\n\nHaaland is the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary. The Interior Department oversees Indian schools, which churches began running in 1819 through federal funding.\n\nConditions at former Indian schools gained global attention last month when tribal leaders in Canada announced the discovery of the unmarked graves of 215 children at the site of a former residential school for indigenous children.\n\nThe Canadian government said its indigenous residential schools, the last of which closed in 1996, carried out \"cultural genocide.\" Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has found at least 4,100 students died in the schools.\n\nFlandreau, which is still operating, was founded in 1892. At the time the ethos of such schools was expressed by U.S. Civil War veteran General Richard Pratt, who founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania in 1879 and said: \"Kill the Indian, save the man.\"\n\nChristine Diindiissi McCleave, chief executive officer of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, said unmarked graves linked to Indian schools also exist in the United States.\n\n\"It's a little bit annoying that so many people are shocked by that news\" from Canada, McCleave said. \"We've been trying to tell people about this for years.\"\n\nPreston McBride, a Dartmouth College scholar, has documented at least 1,000 deaths at just four of the over 500 schools that existed in the United States, including the non-boarding schools on Indian reservations. His research has examined deaths from 1879 to 1934.\n\nThe deaths were primarily from diseases made far more lethal in many of the schools because of poor treatment. The actual number of deaths is thought to be much higher.\n\n\"It's quite likely that 40,000 children died either in or because of these institutions,\" said McBride, who estimates that tens of thousands more children were simply never again in contact with their families or their tribes after being sent off to the schools.\n\n\"This is on the order of magnitude of something like the Trail of Tears,\" McBride said, referring to the government's forced displacement of Native Americans between 1830 and 1850. \"Yet it's not talked about.\"\n\nMarsha Small, a Montana State University doctoral student, uses ground-penetrating radar to locate unmarked graves, including at the Chemawa Indian School cemetery in Salem, Oregon. The cemetery was left in disarray after original stone markers were leveled in 1960. So far she's found 222 sets of remains but says much more work is required to have a full accounting.\n\n\"Until we can find those kids and let their elders come get them or know where they can pay respects, I don't think the native is going to heal, and as such I don't think America is going to heal,\" Small said.\n\nChemawa, founded in 1880, is still operating.\n\nNative Americans acknowledge that the schools still operating have changed in important ways. Many are now under tribal oversight and children are taught their home languages instead of being punished for speaking them. But the schools have yet to acknowledge their pasts, said the coalition's McCleave and others.\n\n\"Before we can move forward, they have to recognize that legacy,\" she said.\n\nChemawa referred Reuters to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Education and the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to emailed questions about acknowledging the schools' pasts, efforts being made to find unmarked graves, and whether the bureau supports a congressional commission.\n\nAurelio Morrillo, a 2020 Chemawa graduate who was raised for several years on the Gila River reservation in Arizona, said that while there he was never taught about the school's past.\n\n\"I feel like something is being hidden that we still don't know about,\" he said.\n\nReporting by Brad Brooks in Lubbock, Texas; Editing by Donna Bryson and Grant McCool",

            "description": "What Justin Trudeau wants from the G-7  Politico",
            "content": "Welcome to Corridors. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau steps back into the real world this week after months of sticking close to home. Andy Blatchford talked to insiders about what Canada wants at the G-7 summit. Zi-Ann Lum reports on Canada\u2019s latest reckoning. Nick Taylor-Vaisey previews the wind down of Parliament, plus we have the latest on the Canada-U.S. border.\n\nTHE BIDEN-TRUDEAU REUNION \u2014 The PM and the president will meet in person this week for the first time since Biden was elected. Although they\u2019ve made the best of video split-screens \u2014 and have a bilateral road map to prove it \u2014 we all know it\u2019s hard to beat real life face time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like sitting in person to compare notes,\u201d a senior government official told Andy during a presummit briefing.\n\n\u2014 No-hug reunion: On a visit to London in the Before Times, a video of Trudeau went viral featuring a hot-mic moment at a NATO cocktail party when he and other world leaders poked some fun at a former U.S. president. Expect Trudeau to avoid the social circuit in London, mindful of the way such images could play back at home.\n\nDuring the family photo at the G-7 finance ministers last weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared center of the frame, the only leader in a mask.\n\n\u2014 What\u2019s on Canada\u2019s radar: Trudeau and Canadian officials are focused on three Cs: Covid-19, China and climate.\n\nCount on Trudeau to raise the detentions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, the two Canadians who have been jailed in China for more than 900 days. Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said this week that Canada has been in \"regular contact\" with Huawei Technologies, Beijing and Washington about the men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve met where they\u2019re all lined up on the major issues,\u201d the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the 2021 cohort of G-7 leaders.\n\n\u201cFor four years, they had Trump. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff to try to get done. The G-7 needs to step up and it wasn\u2019t able to do that on those big, important issues and others while there were such divergences of view as there were in the four years of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Speaking of Trump: As Andy explains it, Trump\u2019s arrival on the world stage and his determination to rip up NAFTA upended Trudeau\u2019s aspirations for the world stage.\n\n\u201cEven the domestic agenda got disrupted by how all-hands-on-deck Canada had to be to defend NAFTA,\u201d said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThat largely came to define the challenge of those first four years.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Building back better: The G-7, the official said, will produce \u201ca lot of good movement\u201d on China by contesting the superpower in areas like human rights, while pushing on trade and climate issues. Look for the G-7 to try to advance commitments on democracy, gender and oceans that the group put forward in 2018, when Canada hosted the summit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around the block a couple of times on these sorts of summits \u2014 and I think this is going to be a really significant one,\u201d the official added.\n\nThis week, Corridors asks: What\u2019s the most important thing Trudeau needs to accomplish at the G-7 summit?\n\n\u2014 Colin Robertson, former Canadian diplomat: In strategic terms there is Canada's relationship with the USA, our principal ally and trading partner. Trudeau will get real face time (not virtual) with Biden at the G-7 and NATO summit. This is always useful especially now we have a roadmap aiming to take the partnership to a new level.\n\nWe balance the U.S. relationship with multilateralism where the rules-based-system (designed and sustained by U.S. presidents until Trump) levels the playing field and allows Canada to play on areas of expertise. Trudeau, for example, has gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \u2014 themes that will underline G-7 discussions on everything from debt relief to Covid recovery and \u201cbuilding back better.\u201d\n\nProgress, quiet but incremental \u2014 how the G-7 works \u2014 is an achievement.\n\nMultilateralism is undergoing its most severe stress test since it was created after the Second World War \u2014 the rise of China that offers an alternative, authoritarian-based order and an aggressive, disruptive Russia that respects no norms or rules.\n\nWhen Trump proclaimed and acted on \u201dAmerica First,\u201d the multilateral system drifted and broke down (the \u201cevery nation for itself\u201d Covid response is one example). If the leading democracies can come out of the G-7 and NATO summits with cohesion and purpose, and Trudeau has played the traditional Canadian role of \u201chelpful fixer,\u201d then Canadian interests are well served.\n\n\u2014 Robert Asselin, senior vice-president of policy at the Business Council of Canada: The G-7 has lost a lot of heft in the last decade. I experienced it first hand when I was director of policy to the minister of finance from 2015-2017.\n\nOther than facilitating bilateral meetings, it has lost focus and a clear sense of purpose.\n\nThe world is going through a significant reset on the geopolitical front, what some have called the return of geo-economics. The Washington Consensus is being replaced with a harder-edged focus on national interests and comparative advantages.\n\nThe obvious but difficult question G-7 leaders are faced with right now is how \u2014 and if \u2014 advanced economies will collectively deal with China going forward. Canada needs to be ahead of this push for a G-7 renewed agenda. The commitment of President Biden to re-engage the U.S on the multilateral front is timely on that front.\n\nCorridors is a new weekly newsletter for MPs, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\u2019s going on around Parliament Hill. Every Wednesday we will look at the people pulling the levers of power in Ottawa and the questions that are influencing decisions on Parliament Hill and in the provinces. Join the conversation! You can email us at [email protected], [email protected], [email protected], [email protected].\n\n\u2018THIS IS OUR CANADA\u2019 \u2014 Leaders of all levels were in London, Ontario, last evening to attend a vigil for a family run down Sunday by a driver in a pickup truck. A nine-year-old boy is in hospital, the only survivor of a rampage that killed his sister, parents and grandmother.\n\n\u201cIslamophobia is real. Racism is real,\u201d Trudeau told the crowd about the hit and run that killed three generations of a family. Earlier in the day, he told the House that the hit and run was an act of terrorism.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Zi-Ann Lum connects the day of mourning to a mass shooting at a Quebec City mosque and to the discovery of the remains of 215 children on the grounds of a former residential school in Kamloops.\n\n\u201cI love my home. I love this place,\u201d NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Tuesday. \u201cBut the reality is this is our Canada.\u201d\n\nTWO-DOSE BORDER CROSSERS \u2014Trudeau says Canada\u2019s eventual moves to loosen restrictions at the border will be tied to science: when folks are fully vaccinated \u2014 with two doses \u2014 they are far more protected from the virus and less likely to spread it. He also said this week that the reopening will take a phased-in approach. On the timing of those eased back measures, he\u2019s offered up less information. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have more to announce in the coming weeks on which measures we can loosen for those who have two doses,\u201d Trudeau told a press conference Tuesday.\n\nPoliticians and business leaders on both sides of the frontier have been pressuring governments to start peeling back the measures to help boost the hobbled tourism industry and allow people to reunite with family members. The calls have been intensifying with the approach of the June 21 expiry date of the U.S.-Canada agreement on the border restrictions. On Monday, the mayors of two Canadian border cities told POLITICO that Public Safety Minister Bill Blair signaled the Trudeau government could start easing border restrictions on June 22 if the country\u2019s vaccination campaign stays on its current trajectory.\n\nThe Biden administration, which has been pressed to release a reopening plan by lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has so far kept pretty quiet about its approach. \u201cWe would make a decision about the Canada border based on the guidance of our health and medical experts and I'm sure that when that decision is made, we would communicate through diplomatic channels,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday. \u201cBut I don't have anything to predict about the timeline.\u201d Some things are moving, however. This week, the State Department changed its travel advisory for Canada, to \u201creconsider\u201d from \u201cdo not travel.\u201d\n\nRep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.) senses that the days of cross-border shopping are getting closer. In a statement, he said he\u2019s had conversations with \u201cgovernment leaders\u201d on both sides of the border who have informed him that reopening plans are progressing. \u201cIt is clearly the beginning of the end of the border shutdown between the U.S. and Canada,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Related reading: Multiple sources tell the Toronto Star to expect more news as soon as Friday on how all of these details will shake out.\n\nSILLY SEASON IS BACK \u2014 The race to Parliament\u2019s first regularly scheduled summertime adjournment since the 2019 election grants MPs a modicum of pre-pandemic normalcy. They have two weeks of sittings to rush through and/or stymie whatever\u2019s left on the order paper.\n\nLast week, Corridors caught you up on the legislative buffet of government priorities \u2014 everything\u2019s a priority until it\u2019s not \u2014 that spans the Liberal legislative agenda. Little has changed in seven days. C-10, the Broadcasting Act overhaul that hit a brick wall of opposition and public outcry, languished at committee until the Liberals and Bloc teamed up to limit debate using a controversial procedural tool. MPs at the environment committee struggled to coherently debate C-12, which would chart a path to net-zero emissions. At least it made it that far. C-11, the consumer privacy law overhaul that met the ire of the privacy commissioner, is stuck at second reading in the House. The same is true of C-21, which would launch a buyback program for banned \"assault-style\" weapons and allow cities to ban handguns \u2014 and was once marketed by Public Safety Minister Bill Blair as signature legislation.\n\n\u2014 Budgeting time: Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland is no doubt keen on seeing C-30 receive royal assent. The House finance committee passed amendments to Freeland's budget implementation bill that would force her to claw back subsidies doled out to publicly traded companies that still found a way to pay dividends to their shareholders. The Senate national finance committee launched a pre-study of the bill. Senators just need their elected counterparts to walk it down Wellington Street.\n\n\u2014 Indigenous rights: On Monday, a Senate committee started clause-by-clause analysis of C-15, the government bill that would create a framework to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As that work fights the parliamentary calendar in the shadow of the horrific discovery of more than 200 unmarked children's graves outside a former residential school in Kamloops, NDP MP Leah Gazan will today seek unanimous consent for a motion that would call on the government to acknowledge that atrocities committed at residential schools were part of a genocide against Indigenous people.\n\nThoughts and prayers boilerplate, this was not. The Commons grieved the brutal killing of four Muslim Canadians in London, Ont., who were out for an evening stroll on Sunday. \u201cThis is our Canada,\u201d he said, juxtaposing his love for the country against a reality of rampant racism. \u201cHow many more families will be killed?\u201d Singh\u2019s angry tone broke a string of sombre, polite remarks from party leaders \u2014 a jarring reminder that for the NDP leader, this issue is personal.\n\nHarder\u2019s cutting critique of Bill C-10 popped up in her Alberta riding\u2019s biggest newspaper late last week. Harder told the Lethbridge Herald that CanCon grants, which streaming giants like Netflix would pay into if the bill becomes law, reward a \u201cvery niche group\u201d of \u201coutdated artists\u201d who are \u201cnot able to make a living off of what they are producing.\u201d Harder singled out Quebecers. By Monday, she'd apologized in a tweet \u2014 en francais, seulement \u2014 that hastily took it all back.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Shelly Hagan previews today\u2019s policy decision from the Bank of Canada.\n\nMaclean\u2019s editor-at-large Sarmishta Subramanian considers a lost year in education. \u201cHow to ensure children don\u2019t get left behind is a puzzle with enormous stakes,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cIt was clipboard-toting civil servant meets spliff-smoking hippie.\u201d In the Walrus, author and science writer Alanna Mitchell looks at how a team of statisticians worked to figure out the value of Canada\u2019s weed business.\n\nWriting in the Guardian U.S., Hilary Beaumont writes on reports of harassment and assault in Minnesota along the Line 3 pipeline route.\n\nIn POLITICO Magazine, Michael Kruse looks at the ways the gubernatorial campaign of Caitlyn Jenner has blurred the boundaries between celebrity and politics in ways even Donald Trump never imagined.\n\n\u2014 Climate talks face rich-poor coronavirus vaccine divide.\n\n\u2014 Biden to shore up supply chains for four sectors after 100-day reviews.\n\n\u2014 Privacy czar: Trudeau's privacy reform may not survive.\n\n\u2014 G-7 health ministers agree to clinical trials charter.\n\n\u2014 Liberals will answer to electorate if Canada fails to meet climate targets, senators told.\n\nSpotted: Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Desmond Cole, Ronald J. Deibert, Alex Marland and Karin Wells in the running for this year's Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing \u2026 Conservative MP and former intern Brad Vis inviting the House to celebrate the upcoming 80th birthday of James Ross Hurley, who in 1969 helped to found the Parliamentary Internship Program. \u2026 Liberal MP Tim Louis planting 300 trees with his daughter Brooklyn.\n\nBirthdays: Belatedly, HBD to former PM Joe Clark, 82 on June 5. \u2026 Best wishes today to Green MP Elizabeth May (67) and Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault (51) \u2026 Sen. Victor Oh will be 72 tomorrow \u2026 MP Dave MacKenzie will be 75 on June 12, the same day Conservative MP Cathy McLeod turns 64. \u2026 Toronto MP and podcaster Nathaniel Erskine-Smith will be 37 on June 15.\n\nMedia mentions: Lucy van Oldenbarneveld made headlines as she announced she\u2019s leaving CBC Ottawa at the end of the month. \u201cI'm getting a call from my gut that I need to do something else,\u201d she explained. \u2026 More big news in Ottawa as Mark Sutcliffe announced that he is leaving daily radio. \u2026 In other Ottawa media moves, David Reevely shares that he is an incoming correspondent for The Logic. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to be part of building something new,\u201d he tweeted. \u2026 The National Observer\u2019s Carl Meyer is on assignment: \u201ca long-term investigation into the effectiveness of nap time.\u201d He returns from parental leave in January. \u2026 Finally, congrats to the 2021-23 Canadian Association of Journalists\u2019 board of directors.\n\nLast week first: On June 4, 1979, Flora MacDonald became the first woman to be appointed Secretary of State for External Affairs.

In strategic terms there is Canada's relationship with the USA, our principal ally and trading partner. \n\nThe obvious but difficult question G-7 leaders are faced with right now is how \u2014 and if \u2014 advanced economies will collectively deal with China going forward.",

            "content": "Editor's note: Pro\u2019s Morning Canada will not publish July 1. We\u2019ll return to your inbox Friday, July 2.\n\nWelcome to Corridors. I'm your host, Nick Taylor-Vaisey. In today's edition, serious reflection on how Canadians should mark their national holiday on Thursday. The Senate makes quick work of two Liberal priorities and deliberately slows progress on two others. Catherine McKenna leaves politics on her own terms, and the PM and POTUS make a friendly wager.\n\nHOW TO MARK A NATIONAL DAY \u2014 Canada Day feels different this year. Victoria and Fredericton, a pair of provincial capitals that typically throw celebrations replete with countless flags and a sea of revelers in red, have cancelled plans. The local official bash near you, already tamped down by Covid, might also have been paused this year.\n\nThe discovery of nearly 1,000 unmarked graves at former residential school sites in the last month has struck a mournful tone across the nation. First Nations leaders have urged non-Indigenous Canadians to reflect on their country's painful history instead of glorifying it.\n\nSome polling suggests the horrifying revelations have made an impact. Ipsos found that 77 percent of the country supports a national day of remembrance for victims of residential schools. The Angus Reid Institute says twice as many Canadians \u2014 20 percent \u2014 list Indigenous issues as a top priority than this time last year.\n\nPostmedia reported that only 14 percent of Canadians want to see Canada Day abolished, and two-thirds actually want to see more of the Maple Leaf out in the world.\n\n\u2014 What really matters to Canadians: Corridors asked Darrell Bricker, the CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs, what he sees as day-to-day priorities as Canada Day approaches. Covid is still top of mind, he said. Economic anxiety is second.\n\n\u2014 What about reconciliation? Bricker said respondents will consistently list Indigenous issues as a top-10 priority, but rarely in the top 3. \"The past record suggests that these tend to become flashpoints,\" he said, citing the Idle No More protests in 2013 and railway protests last year that faded from frontpages and news broadcasts. He acknowledged this time could be different, observing that Canadians are likely to reckon with many more unmarked graves.\n\n\"There might be a lot of people wearing orange shirts on Canada Day,\" said Bricker, referring to a movement to commemorate the impact of residential schools on children. \"The real question is: What\u2019s the next Canada Day going to look like?\"\n\nThis week, Corridors asks: How should Canadians mark Canada Day?\n\nSol Mamakwa, Ontario NDP MPP for Kiiwetinoong, on Twitter: This year, Canada Day should be nothing more than a day of reflection. I will not celebrate the birth of a nation that destroyed our children. Instead, I will continue to mourn for our lost children and dig deep to find the strength to help build a path toward a better future. For all of us, this is a good time to reflect on the dark roots of Canada and to commit to doing better now and in the future. For all our children\u2019s sake.\n\nNatan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami: We need space and time to have a special place of mourning for children who lost their lives. On this particular Canada Day, I think we should think very solemnly about those children whose remains are being found, and what that actually means in the context of Canada.\n\nWe should also think hard about our own children, and the children we love. And then imagine that there was no way for parents and families of those children to do anything to change their fate. They had no rights. They had no power. It was the church, the RCMP and the state that upheld what happened to those children.\n\nHaving those conversations as part of this Canada Day will allow us to celebrate future Canada Days together, rather than a particular group of people thinking this is a celebration \u2014 on the backs of a loss of life and policies that are felt in our communities every single day.\n\nIf there was another scenario where there was huge sadness caused by loss of life, and it happened around a major holiday, that holiday would be muted as well. It doesn\u2019t have to be so political. It just has to be about the human response to grief and loss, especially when it\u2019s so tragic and needless.\n\nTeara Fraser, CEO of Iskwew Air: As a M\u00e9tis woman, I am both colonized and colonizer \u2014 living and breathing both a dominant and an Indigenous worldview, often, if not always, at the same time.\n\nThis Canada Day is a day of reflection, of truth telling. How did Canada come to be?\n\nCanada is built on the genocide of Indigenous peoples. What do we have to celebrate?\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to stand fiercely for the lives of stolen children.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to stand fiercely for the land, the land that has been holding these precious children.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to acknowledge, to be still, to grieve, to heal, to honor.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to ask ourselves what we plan to do to dismantle the systems that allow for the continued genocide of Indigenous peoples.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to decolonize \u2014 shining light on the dominant social, political, economic, and judicial structures and systems that have overshadowed Indigenous ways of knowing and being.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to step into action with the TRC\u2019s 94 Calls to Action and the Reclaiming Power and Place 231 Calls to Justice.\n\nThis Canada Day, and every day, we need to amplify and honor Indigenous voices, worldviews and wisdoms.\n\nThis Canada Day we can begin a journey of collective restoration. Imagine what is possible. Let\u2019s begin.\n\nSOBER SECOND THOUGHT \u2014 The Red Chamber adjourned until the fall without passing a pair of Liberal legislative priorities. Every senator who spoke to Bill C-10, the effort to rewrite the Broadcasting Act and regulate streaming giants, said the proposal needs close scrutiny at committee. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault urged senators on Monday to \"work diligently\" to pass C-10 before their summer break. Not a single one saw things his way.\n\nThe bill is now the transport and communication committee's problem to solve. There's no plan for that group to meet any time soon. An election call before Parliament meets again would scupper C-10, which would die on the order paper along with all other unresolved business.\n\n\u2014 Related reading: What exactly did senators say about C-10? One of the bill's most vocal critics, law prof Michael Geist, dissects the debate.\n\n\u2014 The Senate's last Act: Senators did push through C-30, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's budget bill that extends Covid benefits, and C-12, the net-zero emissions framework. Both will get the royal assent treatment. On Monday, the chamber sent C-6, the Liberal attempt to ban conversion therapy, to committee for further study. The bill only cleared the Commons last week, giving the other chamber very little time to actually debate it. Like C-10, C-6 will have to wait until the Senate reconvenes. Welcome to legislative purgatory, which won't prevent the Liberals from campaigning on both bills if they end up on the campaign trail.\n\nON HER OWN TERMS \u2014 Catherine McKenna isn't running for a third term in Ottawa Centre. The infrastructure minister whose signature achievement in government was setting a national carbon price cleared the way for new blood in her riding. Eight years in office, she said, was enough. Now she'll devote herself fully to fighting climate change in other ways \u2014 and spend more time with her kids, too. McKenna's swan song was partially drowned out by a torrent of interest in her potential successor. That'd be Mark Carney, who she says \"is a good friend of mine, and I think he can make a big difference.\u201d\n\nSO LONG, BIG APPLE \u2014 Catherine Loubier, Quebec\u2019s delegate general to New York, announced that in early August she will leave her post on the 26th floor at One Rockefeller Plaza Center. When it comes to what\u2019s next, she says stay tuned. For now, she tells Andy she\u2019s going to be a \u201cfree agent\u201d \u2014 but she expects she\u2019ll end up contributing to Quebec\u2019s prosperity one way or another. Politics, perhaps? \u201cNo, the door is closed,\u201d says Loubier, who handled the transition for Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s government and worked as a senior adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper. \u201cThe door is not closed for the rest of my life, but there\u2019s no immediate plans or midterm plans.\u201d\n\nMission accomplished: Loubier says she\u2019s proud of several accomplishments from her time in New York, which started in February 2019. They include working to make inroads for Quebec hydropower, acting as \u201cfirst responders\u201d to counter protectionism threats like tariffs and Buy America, helping boost exports and opening doors for foreign direct investment into the province.\n\nA FRIENDLY WAGER \u2014 Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden agreed, via Twitter, to bet on the outcome of the Stanley Cup final. Trudeau is an avowed fan of the Montreal Canadiens, and Biden was game to take the side of the Tampa Bay Lightning. The confusing wrinkle here is they don't appear to be actually wagering anything yet. The PMO told Nick there are no specifics to report.\n\n\u2014 One-way trade: Gambling isn't new to the PM/POTUS relationship. In 2014, then-PM Harper and then-prez Barack Obama put a case of beer on the line for both the men's and women's Olympic finals. (Harper collected 48 cold ones.) In 2010, Harper won the same bet. (Another 48 showed up at 24 Sussex in the hands of the U.S. ambassador.)\n\n\u2014 Quip of the day: Brian Higgins, a New York congressman who's aggressively pushing for a border reopening crashed the party: \"I have an idea. Everyone wins if we reopen the border.\"\n\nTHE MORE WE KNOW \u2014 Thank god for Rob Morrison, the Conservative MP for Kootenay-Columbia, B.C. If he hadn't formally demanded to know how much Statistics Canada spent to come up with playlists meant to showcase Canadian artists to citizens while they filled out this year's census, we'd never have learned the feds ponied up $59.94 (plus taxes) for a six-month subscription to a premium Spotify account. The playlists' labor costs added up to $770.40.\n\n\u2014 The less we'll find out: When the House adjourned for the summer, dozens of written questions on the order paper \u2014 an alternative to the oral theater of question period that requires departments to provide legit responses within 45 sitting days \u2014 sat abandoned. Tory MP Blake Richards tops the list with a query for a list of meetings between Canadian and American officials on the Line 5 pipeline. Bloc MP Xavier Barsalou-Duval wants to know how many bureaucrats work on the prime minister's website. Another Tory, Scott Reid, penned a 647-word question that probes for details about Canada's secretive vaccine contracts. An election would doom these enquiries to the parliamentary dustbin. For now.\n\nFor the first time ever, Canada's vice-chief of the defence staff is a woman. Lt.-Gen. Frances Allen was named the second-most senior military leader at a ceremony earlier this week. Allen will help lead the military through a transformation she called \"complex, elaborate, and nuanced.\" Another adjective for the job ahead: dizzying. The brass are facing a mess of misconduct investigations that exemplify a toxic culture that starts at the top. Allen's 38-year career last saw her posted as Canada's rep at NATO in Brussels. (Fun fact: She once served a stint in the Diefenbunker.)\n\nAs Indigenous people in Canada mourned the discovery of unmarked graves on the site of a residential school in Kamloops run by the Catholic church, the Pope tweeted his \"closeness to the Canadian people\" and encouraged his followers \"to turn away from the colonial model.\" The Catholic order that ran dozens of the schools has committed to releasing documents they'd withheld for decades. They also apologized for their role. But the Pope hasn't. The church's conduct has some veteran politicos musing about the end of separate schools in Ontario.\n\nCorridors is a new weekly newsletter for MPs, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\u2019s going on around Parliament Hill.

Jane Cordy celebrates 71 years on Friday. \u2026 The same day, Liberal MP Linda Lapointe is 61. \u2026 Saturday marks 60 years from Adam Vaughan, the veteran Liberal MP in downtown Toronto. \u2026 The late Deepak Obhrai, a beloved Tory in the Harper years, would have been 71 on Sunday. \u2026 Bloc MP Alain Therrien is 55 years old next Tuesday.\n\nMedia mentions: Laura Dhillon Kane is now the news editor in the Canadian Press's Ottawa bureau (she had been serving in an acting role). Please note: The bureau is hiring. \u2026 News Media Canada, the biggest lobby group for Canada's newspapers, named Paul Deegan as president and CEO. He once served as deputy executive director of the National Economic Council in Bill Clinton's White House.\n\nIn a moving thread on Twitter Tuesday evening, Cynthia Mulligan explained that she is taking the summer off. \"I'm not living with cancer, it's just hitching a ride on my amazing life,\" the CityNews journalist tweeted. She was previously treated for breast cancer in 2010.\n\nPower moves: In case you missed it, Paul Rochon took on a gig as executive adviser to Deloitte Canada, where he'll offer strategic advice on infrastructure, the energy transition and digital identity. The former deputy minister of finance left the department in December after leading its grueling pandemic response.\n\nFarewells: Rabbi Reuven Bulka, a popular figure in Ottawa's Jewish community who was known as \"Canada's rabbi,\" died Sunday at 77. Former prime minister Stephen Harper marked Bulka's passing: \"His lifelong mission and message of respectful compassion toward one another will remain with me, and will be a defining pillar of his legacy.\"\n\nLast week first: On June 23, 1896, Sir Wilfrid Laurier came to power with a majority government despite losing the popular vote. Laurier's Liberals won 118 seats, besting the 88 in which Charles Tupper's Conservatives came out on top. Tupper, the shortest-serving PM in Canadian history, refused to resign until two weeks later. Kudos to Arthur Drache, the fastest to hit reply with the correct answer, as well as Michael Reed and Daniel Lis.\n\nExtra points to Kalin McCluskey for aptly describing Tupper as \"gloriously mutton chopped.\"\n\nThis week\u2019s question: Canada's Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall recently announced a Canadian author was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in May. Name that author.\n\nWith thanks this week to editor Sue Allan, Zi-Ann Lum and Andy Blatchford.",

            "content": "Activists in British Columbia are erecting blockades to try to prevent logging of ancient trees on Indigenous lands.\n\nVancouver Island, Canada \u2013 A colossal battle to save the last temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, Canada is under way, as police and forest protectors are engaged in a cat-and-mouse chase through hundreds of kilometres of thick woods.\n\nThe Rainforest Flying Squad, a volunteer-driven activists\u2019 group, is behind efforts to stop logging companies from extracting old-growth trees in and around the Fairy Creek forest, an area with some of the little remaining old-growth in the province of British Columbia (BC).\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have arrested more than 150 activists during the past three weeks while enforcing an injunction obtained in March by Teal-Jones Group, one of the main logging companies, to remove the forest defenders.\n\nBut that has not deterred hundreds of activists, who have flocked to Canada\u2019s west coast to try to save the forest of gigantic, rare strands of western red cedar and yellow cedar trees, some of which are estimated to be between 800 and 2,000 years old.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that as of Monday all the camps are intact,\u201d said Saul Arbess, a cultural anthropologist from Victoria, BC, who has been involved with the blockades since they began last August. The activists are camped out in various strategic locations that the Rainforest Flying Squad has chosen to block loggers from felling the trees.\n\nDeemed ancient by the BC government if they are older than 250 years, they can tower as high as 25 metres (82 feet) and measure 3.5 metres (12 feet) in diameter. The trees form a cathedral of stunning forest in the coastal, mountainous region that is home to threatened species such as the Western screech owl and a blend of centuries-old firs and hemlocks.\n\n\u201cThese trees anchor the entire ecosystem and they\u2019re some of the oldest living things on the planet. And when you cut them down, you are not just destabilising the ecosystem, you\u2019re on the road to ruin,\u201d Arbess told Al Jazeera. \u201cThat\u2019s what this struggle is all about.\u201d\n\nTeal-Jones Group owns Tree Farm License 46, which encompasses the area of the Fairy Creek blockades. The licence spans 3,828 hectares (9459 acres) of old-growth forest; it is one of the last large unlogged watersheds on southern Vancouver Island.\n\nThe company, which bought the logging and milling rights from the Province of BC in 2004, stands to profit an estimated $20m from logging 200 hectares (494 acres) of old-growth trees here. Old-growth trees are coveted by industry for their \u201ctight clear wood\u201d \u2013 smooth and ideal for products such as shingles and decking.\n\nIn an email to Al Jazeera, a representative for Teal-Jones said it holds the right to harvest in the disputed area. \u201cWe are a value-added manufacturer. We do not export logs or jobs but mill all timber we cut right here in the province, utilizing 100 per cent of every log,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cTeal Jones has a decades-long history of engagement with First Nations, responsible forest management, and value-added manufacture in BC. The company plants well in excess of one million new trees every year.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Canadian Press news agency, Gerrie Kotze, vice president of Teal Cedar\u2019s, a subsidiary of Teal-Jones Group, also said the company\u2019s plans for the area have been \u201cmischaracterised\u201d. Kotze said the company is only planning to harvest \u201ca small area up at the head of the watershed\u201d \u2013 about 200 hectares (494 acres) \u2013 and that most of the Fairy Creek watershed is unavailable for logging.\n\nBut forest defenders as young as 15 are chaining and cementing themselves into the ground and perched high in the trees to block the loggers\u2019 entrance, while other supporters are eager to get arrested for what they believe is a revolutionary cause. \u201cIntact old growth ecosystems make up less than 1 percent (860,000 hectares) of B.C.\u2019s remaining forests,\u201d Greenpeace says.\n\nThe area in question sits in the traditional territories of the Pacheedaht and Ditidaht First Nations, who are caught between a colonial, elected governance leadership that has expressed support for the logging \u2013 and traditional hereditary leadership that has denounced it.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather implored to us that the Ferry Lake area, and the two creeks there, were our spiritual holy places,\u201d Pacheedaht Elder Bill Jones, 81, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIf the trees are cut down, I think that will be the end of our own hopes of resurrecting our past culture, which in fact, is dead on this reserve \u2013 that we will not have any means to address our original, spiritual relationship.\u201d\n\nJones is a survivor of Canada\u2019s infamous residential schools system, an assimilative tactic the government put in place from the late 1800s until 1996. Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and taken to live in the schools, where they often experienced abuses of every kind.\n\nLast week, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation announced it had found mass unmarked graves containing the remains of 215 Indigenous children at Kamloops Indian Residential School, also in BC, sparking global outrage about the mistreatment of Indigenous peoples.\n\nJones equated his community\u2019s disconnection from their culture and spirituality to residential schools and other colonial violence. He said he is tired of mourning everything that has been lost, and does not want the last of his peoples\u2019 lands to be pillaged.\n\n\u201cI call this entrapment, you know, where they set up a trap, the government. We have no money, we owe money. Even the elected Chief Jeff Jones is locked into contracts with the government and Teal Jones, but we get very little of the profit and don\u2019t have any influence on forest management,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBC\u2019s forestry industry is a cornerstone of its economy. It provides 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributes nearly $13bn to the provincial GDP, according to a 2019 report by the BC Council of Forest Industries.\n\nPremier John Horgan promised to protect old-growth forests during his election campaign last fall, but his government has continued to issue licenses to harvest the trees. It also said its management plans will protect old-growth, but activists have rejected that as insufficient.\n\nArbess said activists are \u201casking the government to stop, to make deferrals\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd also, we are not opposed as such to logging. We are not opposed to the loggers, to the logging families. There\u2019s a tradition that exists in those families. We want that to continue, but we want that to be in work that is sustainable in terms of the forest,\u201d Arbess said.\n\nA logger working in the area who asked not to be identified for fear of losing his job told Al Jazeera that he identifies as an environmentalist, but is sick of the blockades holding him up from doing his work. He said all the trees should be cut down because they will simply grow back.\n\n\u201cA 2,000-year-old tree is just a tree,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the struggle continues, three First Nations formally notified the province on June 5 of a request \u201cto defer old-growth logging for two years in the Fairy Creek and the Central Walbran areas\u201d. The Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, and Pacheedaht said that would give them time to \u201cprepare their plans\u201d for the areas and comes \u201cin addition to the decision of Huu-ay-aht First Nations to defer logging of its treaty lands\u201d.\n\nIn an email, Horgan\u2019s office told Al Jazeera that \u201cthese nations are the holders of constitutionally protected Indigenous interests within their traditional territories. It is from this position that the Chiefs have approached us\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe further recognize the three Nations will continue to exercise their constitutionally protected Indigenous interests over the protected areas. And we are pleased to enter into respectful discussions with the Nations regarding their request.\u201d\n\nTeal-Jones Group also said it acknowledges that it is operating in the traditional territories of the First Peoples and is working with those Indigenous nations. \u201cWe will abide by the declaration issued today, and look forward to engaging with the Pacheedaht, Ditidaht, and Huu-ay-aht First Nations as they develop Integrated Resource Forest Stewardship Plans,\u201d the company\u2019s statement read.\n\nIn a June 4 opinion piece in the Vancouver Sun, BC\u2019s minister of forests, lands, natural resource operations and rural development wrote that the province is halting old-growth harvesting licensing. \u201cPacheedaht, industry tenure holders, and the province have agreed that no harvesting will happen in Fairy Creek while the Pacheedaht develop their own stewardship plan,\u201d Katrine Conroy wrote, adding that the government anticipates more deferrals of old-growth logging to be announced during the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, activists are still flocking to the forest in hopes of saving the ancient trees.\n\nFor months, a 69-year-old retired environmental epidemiologist who goes by the code name Bluebird has been making the trek from his home in Victoria with his wife to support the Rainforest Flying Squad.\n\n\u201cThe planet needs forests. When you feel the power of an old forest here, the air, it gives you energy walking in there,\u201d Bluebird told Al Jazeera from the main camp run by the activist group. With tears forming in his eyes, he added that the forest is \u201cthe best carbon system we\u2019ve ever had\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to build a fancy carbon storage system, we need to keep forests intact; they suck carbon out and keep it there for thousands of years. We\u2019re clear-cutting them and turning them into carbon emitters. Absolutely, there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019m willing to get arrested.\u201d",

            "description": "QAnons Are Harassing People at the Whim of a Woman They Say Is Canada\u2019s Queen  VICE",
            "content": "Didulo, a B.C.-based woman in her 50s, has recently built up a following of thousands of people who listen to her claims of having been put in control of the Great White North by the same forces that QAnon believers think are fighting the deep state in America. QAnon, for the uninitiated, is a wide-ranging, wildly unfactual conspiracy centred upon Donald Trump\u2019s secret fight against an international cabal of elitist pedophiles. Didulo was recently thrust into her position by several well-known QAnon figures who helped anoint her as a leader and in turns sent a swarm of followers her way. But despite her following being only weeks old, Didulo has rallied her Canadian followers to real-life action. They\u2019re in the midst of filing hundreds of \u201ccease and desist\u201d notices demanding businesses, governments, and police forces stop all activities related to combating the pandemic. They have organized themselves into localized groups to email their demands out en masse, send them via registered letter, or simply make their way to stores or police stations in order to physically hand them out. One particularly riled-up group of conspiracy theorists in Cochrane, Alberta, went to over 30 businesses last week to hand out the notices. On June 10 they decided to go to a K-8 school\u2014while children were present\u2014and hand the notices and anti-vax flyers out. They eventually were kicked out and Cochrane RCMP confirmed to VICE World News that two people received trespassing tickets for their actions. The group complained about its mistreatment by police inside its Telegram chat and mulled over \u201cbombarding\u201d the school\u2019s principal with letters.\n\nDidulo has said that if the people who received the cease and desist orders from her followers break them, they will be executed. \u201cPeace, prosperity, or perish,\u201d is one of her slogans, after all. It\u2019s not Didulo who is necessarily important, but her growing and active audience. QAnon, which may, according to a recent poll, have as many as 30 million followers in the U.S. as well as more outside of it, has contributed to real-world violence, including the Capitol Hill uprising. Only a few short years ago, Didulo could have been simply ignored as someone with a grift or a tenuous grip of reality posting videos, but now, thanks to the new QAnon ecosystem, she\u2019s a figure of consequence. In this modern environment, someone claiming to be the secret ruler of Canada and to be holding military tribunals and executions can rapidly gain thousands of followers, some willing to follow her off the deepest creases of the internet and into the real world. To know the volatility of her followers, however, you must first know who they\u2019re following. Didulo is the \u201cleader\u201d of an online political party called the Canada1st Party of Canada\u2014which does not appear to have been officially registered anywhere but has been turned into a corporation by Didulo. She began posting about the party and making videos about her policy in late 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic. However, the party never took off, and she languished in obscurity for some time.\n\nThat all changed in May when she changed tactics and switched her rhetoric to fit several popular QAnon narratives. After getting noticed by a couple of well-known QAnon figures, her profile has been growing rapidly. She now has almost 20,000 followers on Telegram, her primary channel, and a growing and engaged audience. The audience consists of an intersection of QAnon believers, anti-lockdown zealots, and \u201csovereign citizens\u201d (people who think government laws do not apply to them, especially ones related to taxes). And her audience is not a passive one. \u201cHello, Canada, I\u2019m Ramona Didulo, I'm the founder and leader of Canada1st. As of February this year, 2021, I am the head of state and commander in chief of Canada, the Republic,\u201d she said in her announcement video. \u201cThe people who appointed me are the white hats and the U.S. military, together with the global allied troops and their governments\u2014the same group of people who have helped President Trump.\u201d She speaks to her audience either through Telegram posts or via poorly produced videos in which she sits on a couch in front of an empty beige wall. In a follow-up video to her initial decree, Didulo declares herself not only the \u201cthe head of state,\u201d \u201ccommander in chief,\u201d and \u201chead of government,\u201d but also the \u201cQueen of Canada, replacing Queen Elizabeth II of England who has now been executed for crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nMany of Didulo\u2019s followers seem to believe she\u2019s holding tribunals behind the scenes, which are resulting in the executions they\u2019re thirsting for. These followers use extremely tenuous scraps of evidence to prove Didulo is actually in power\u2014including the fact that Romana Didulo is an anagram for \u201cI Am Our Donald.\u201d The violent rhetoric she spouts in her posts and videos seems to be one of the main things driving her popularity. \u201cLet\u2019s keep this simple,\u201d Didulo wrote recently, \u201cdeath is the penalty for crimes against humanity.\u201d This was met with much jubilation from hundreds of followers: \u201cYASSS!!! \ud83d\ude4f,\u201d wrote one; \u201cI\u2019m so happy we have you.\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d wrote another; \u201cshe is the only one that is saying anything hopeful or anything that makes sense\u2026. It felt completely hopeless before Romana came along,\u201d wrote a third. \u201cAs much as I hate to see people being put to death, it has become necessary because the jerks just won't stop what they are doing,\u201d wrote yet another. Pete Smith, a journalist with the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, has been researching Didulo and her rapid rise. Smith said Didulo immigrated to Canada from the Philippines at a young age (something Didulo claims on her own website as well) and that prior to Didulo starting Canada1st in late 2020, she started and quickly shut down several companies and ventures\u2014which weren\u2019t conspiracy-oriented\u2014and that nothing she\u2019s attempted has really taken off before now. Even her initial posts declaring Canada\u2019s new secret rulers were met with relatively little fanfare until she was signalled out by QAnon figures such as Charlie Ward and Whiplash347, who legitimized her to their audiences.\n\n\"It\u2019s their endorsement that seems to have been the cause of all of this,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWithout them, I don\u2019t believe that there is a Canada1st party like we\u2019re seeing right now.\" Drew, an anti-fascist researcher who follows the anti-lockdown group closely (and didn\u2019t want to be named because of fear of reprisal), said he came across Didulo in early 2021 but that she \u201cwas a nobody\u201d until she got big-upped by Q-influencers. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Argentino, a research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence who has written several papers on the QAnon movement, told VICE World News influencers in the QAnon ecosystem \u201chave shown an uncanny capacity to raise unknown individuals to positions of influence in a very short period of time. \u201cIn the absence of \u2018Q,\u2019 influencers in QAnon ecosystems have taken on the mantel of determining what is canon (or authoritative) in these spaces,\u201d said Argentino. \u201cThough they may not always agree, they are able to bestow authority on random individuals. This makes for a volatile ecosystem, which expands radicalization pipelines in unpredictable ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is sending out all these cease and desist orders to stop these mass mask mandate and vaccine mandate crimes and she\u2019s making it very clear that if you violate the crimes you\u2019ll be executed,\u201d said one popular online QAnon influencer in a video on Didulo that received over 30,000 views. \u201cGod bless her; Canada needs somebody like that.\u201d A follower of Didulo told VICE World News that seeing Didulo being spoken about by these figures confirmed to her she was legit and \u201cnot a bullshitter.\u201d The woman, who is active in helping hand out cease and desist notices in Alberta, said she\u2019s attempting to talk to Didulo to confirm some of her claims, but was not able to contact her. Numerous attempts by VICE World News to contact Didulo and people whom she previously worked with before declaring herself Queen went unanswered. \u201cEverywhere I look and the people that I listen to and even people down the States and the UK say she\u2019s here to sidetrack the cabal,\u201d the follower told VICE over the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s a true and sincere person; that\u2019s without a doubt.\u201d Smith said that, as far as he can tell, she is relatively \u201cunique\u201d as a figure leading another country in the conspiracy ecosystem at the moment. Didulo didn\u2019t shrink before the demands put on her by the quick growth of her audience, and posts frequently under the guise that she\u2019s leading Canada. She decreed that Victoria is the new capital of Canada and recently released a video addressing the Indigenous community after the bodies of 215 children were found in a mass grave outside a residential school. She promised to investigate if they were killed for adrenochrome harvesting. (A central tenet of the QAnon conspiracy revolves around the false idea that elites torture and kill children to extract adrenochrome\u2014a substance that can be bought cheaply at chemical supply stores\u2014to maintain their own youth and vitality.)\n\nDidulo\u2019s rapid rise has seen her receive a bit of pushback. Other conspiracy theorists have made videos and blogs claiming she's a government \u201cpsyop\u201d to ruin the true QAnon movement, or that she\u2019s in fact mentally ill. Didulo has responded to her critics by saying everyone who commits fraud about her\u2014or says she\u2019s endorsed companies or products\u2014will be executed. A sizable portion of Didulo\u2019s followers are not passive, and are in the midst of a rather large effort to hand out cease and desists across the country. Didulo instructed her followers to send notices to schools, retirement homes, police stations, grocery stores, hospitals, places of worship, hotels, banks, and so on. Her subjects are loyal and listen to their queen. \"The speed with which her audience has grown and then how quickly they have become active on the street in real life is extremely significant,\u201d said Smith. The cease and desist comes in the form of a PDF they\u2019re sharing. It says it serves as the recipient\u2019s \u201clawful notice to cease and desist\u201d all vaccinations, PCR testing, masking, lockdowns, and quarantines, and border closures. It contains two \u201cspecial notes\u201d at the bottom. The first says that Joe Biden is not actually president and the U.S. military is in charge south of the border; the other says the Canadian Armed Forces have been notified (by email) that Didulo is now in charge.",

            "content": "Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160\u00e1 was eight years old when the missionaries came. Lured from the South Dakota Yankton Indian Reservation with promises of adventure, comfort, and an education, in 1884 the girl went willingly to Wabash, Indiana, to attend a Quaker-run boarding school dedicated to training Native American children.\n\nThen she realized the teachers who had taken her traditional clothing upon her arrival wanted to cut her hair, too. Proud of her long black hair and raised to associate short cuts with the shame of captured warriors, Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160\u00e1 snuck away from the other children. But the adults found her hiding place. They dragged the kicking child into another room and tied her to a chair.\n\n\u201cI cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids,\u201d she wrote in her 1921 memoir American Indian Stories. \u201cThen I lost my spirit.\u201d Renamed Gertrude by the missionaries, Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160\u00e1 would go on to live most of the rest of her childhood at boarding schools for Native students. (Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160\u00e1 went on to fight for suffrage for women and Native Americans.)\n\nShe was one of hundreds of thousands of students who attended such schools in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. The U.S. boarding schools inspired a similar program in Canada, which is now reeling from the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at the residential schools its First Nations children were forced to attend.\n\nThe grisly discovery has also forced a reckoning in the U.S. about its residential boarding schools which punished Native students for speaking their languages, forced them to take new names, and coerced them to convert to Christianity. And many were federally funded in an ambitious attempt to force Native Americans to assimilate into white American society.\n\nNative Americans had inhabited and tended their traditional lands for thousands of years before the arrival of white settlers in the 1600s. Rather than learn from the land\u2019s indigenous people, however, the settlers began to pressure Native Americans to abandon their traditional societies and adopt the ways of the new republic.\n\nIn 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, a law that allowed the federal government to exchange land in the western U.S. for some tribes\u2019 ancestral homelands in the east. But despite brokering more than 350 treaties with Native tribes, the U.S. did not fulfill its promises. Instead of allowing Native people to establish permanent homes in the west, it pushed them onto government-assigned reservations.\n\nAt first, education was in the hands of missionaries, some of whom set up schools on and near the new reservations. But as white settlers flooded into the western U.S. in the mid 19th century, forced assimilation became a federal priority. The government started to invest in mission schools and day schools. But over time, writes historian Ronald C. Naugle, \u201cThe reservation environment, to which the child returned daily, undermined the process of assimilation.\u201d\n\nInstead, the U.S. turned to the idea of off-reservation boarding schools. It found a blueprint in the work of Army General Richard Henry Pratt, who oversaw the education of a group of Native American prisoners of war in Fort Marion, Florida. Pratt\u2019s philosophy was what he called \u201ckill the Indian, and save the man.\u201d He was convinced that if Native children were removed from their Native context and placed in an Anglo one, they would assimilate within a generation.\n\nPratt convinced the federal government to invest in a pricey experiment: a boarding school in Pennsylvania that educated Native children far from home. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School, which Pratt opened in 1879, would become the most prominent of the 25 federally funded off-reservation boarding schools that would open over the next few decades. (More than 300 other day and on-reservation boarding schools received federal funding as well.)\n\nThe Carlisle Indian Industrial School was upheld as a model throughout the nation. Its influence didn\u2019t end there: In 1879, the Canadian government sent lawyer Nicholas Flood Davin to the U.S. on a fact-finding mission. Davin visited the Carlisle school and other institutions and returned to Canada with a glowing review of the new educational system. Davin recommended the government create its own residential school system as soon as possible.\n\nAbuse in the name of assimilation\n\nAt the federal boarding schools, which were located in white communities, children were given Anglo names. Their native languages and cultural practices were forbidden. Their strict educations included language lessons and studies in subjects like manual labor, housekeeping, and farming, and students were usually required to help keep the school self-sufficient by laboring there when they were not in the classroom.\n\nFor many, the schools were hotbeds of humiliation, abuse, and victimization. They were also dangerous. Unsanitary conditions and overcrowding fueled communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, and smallpox, especially among students weakened by trauma and meager rations. Schools had their own cemeteries\u2014and students often built their classmates\u2019 coffins.\n\nOther children died by suicide or ran away. The practice was so common that some schools offered bounties for runaways. \u201cThe temptation to return to their wild life, with the savage influences surrounding them, is no doubt very strong,\u201d wrote one newspaper reporter in a lengthy article about life at White\u2019s Indiana Manual Labor Institute in Wabash, Indiana, the school Zitk\u00e1la-\u0160\u00e1 attended.\n\nYet the U.S. government considered the schools a success\u2014so much so that in 1891, it passed a federal law that made attendance compulsory for Native children. The Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2014the federal agency tasked with distributing food, land, and other provisions included in treaties with Native tribes\u2014withheld food and other goods from those who refused to send their children to the schools, and even sent officers to forcibly take children from the reservation. It was \u201ccivilization by kidnapping,\u201d said one Native American advocate at a 1927 Congressional hearing.\n\nEarlier generations of Native Americans had suffered the loss of nearly all of their lands. Now, the boarding schools broke up their family units and endangered their languages and cultural practices.\n\nBut many Native parents did not part from their children without a fight. One memorable act of protest occurred in 1894, when a group of Hopi men in Arizona refused to send their children to residential schools. Nineteen of them were taken to Alcatraz Island in California, about a thousand miles away from their families, and imprisoned for a year.\n\nThe fight to close the boarding schools\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, however, enthusiasm for the system dwindled and the schools floundered. In 1928, the U.S. government commissioned what is now known as the Meriam Report, a comprehensive update on the state of Native American affairs. Its authors criticized everything from the schools\u2019 deteriorating conditions to the often heavy manual labor the children were forced to perform, and pointed out that the schools relied on long outdated teaching techniques like rote learning and recitation. Students were stiff, hungry, sick, and demoralized, they wrote, and were subjected to harsh physical punishments.\n\nThe report resulted in some immediate changes\u2014among them, the emergency allocation of funds for better food and clothing in the schools. But even though the report recommended dismantling the boarding school system in favor of day schools, the schools persisted.\n\nMeanwhile, the fractures they had introduced into Native culture widened. Native languages began to die out, fueled by children\u2019s absence from the reservation and their forced use of English. Traditional parenting skills were not passed on to younger generations. And over the years, children at the schools reported widespread neglect and physical and sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cThe most debilitating message was one of self-hatred,\u201d writes Mending the Sacred Hoop, a Native-owned nonprofit that works to end violence against Native women. In a 2003 report on the boarding school experience, the nonprofit traced violence in Native American communities\u2014which experience an order of magnitude more violence than their majority white counterparts\u2014to the abuse and trauma many children suffered during their educations.\n\nNative Americans continued to fight to close down the schools. Self-determined education was a priority for the burgeoning pan-Indian movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which granted tribes the ability to assume responsibility for programs that had been administered by the federal government. (The radical history of the Red Power movement\u2019s fight for Native American sovereignty.)\n\nIt was the death knell for most residential schools, but a few remain. Today, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education still directly operates four off-reservation boarding schools in Oklahoma, California, Oregon, and South Dakota. According to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS), a Native-run nonprofit, 15 boarding schools and 73 total schools with federal funding remain open as of 2021.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the federal government began to acknowledge the schools\u2019 grisly legacy. In 2009, Congress passed a joint resolution of apology to Native Americans that included a reference to \u201cthe forcible removal of Native children from their families to faraway boarding schools where their Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden.\u201d In 2016, the U.S. Army began repatriating the remains of some of the bodies buried at the Carlisle Indian School to their tribes and bands. It is the only known effort to do so in the United States; repatriation is ongoing.\n\nThe number of children who were sent to off-reservation residential boarding schools over their century-long history is unclear. But the scars remain\u2014and intergenerational wounds were reopened with recent reports of the unmarked graves in Canada. In response, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, announced the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, a program designed to review the schools\u2019 histories and legacy. The program will investigate known and suspected burial sites.\n\nThe Native American boarding school coalition applauded the initiative. \u201cWe have a right to know what happened to the children who never returned home from Indian boarding schools,\u201d the NABS said in a release. \u201cThe time is now for truth and healing.\u201d",

            "content": "Josu\u00e9 Rivas didn\u2019t know his father well. When he was seven, his mother left Mexico to look for work in the United States, leaving her boy in the care of the man. But Rivas says his dad didn\u2019t know how to be a dad. He was a photographer who struggled with alcoholism and gave away nearly as many portraits as he sold. Under his care, Rivas quickly wound up on the streets and was homeless for four years until his mom came and brought him to America. After that, Rivas didn\u2019t hear from his father much.\n\nBut in the last year, during the pandemic, they reconnected. Rivas told his dad Arturo Rivas Gonzales how his abandonment hurt him. The man was defensive at first, but heard him out. And a month before he died of COVID-19 in February of this year, he called his Mexica and Otomi photographer son to tell him that he wanted to continue to talk about their relationship.\n\nThey never got to have those conversations. The last memories Rivas has of his father are a photo of him in the hospital and a pixelated image of his casket wrapped in plastic to protect the men who were burying him in Guanajuato, Mexico from the novel coronavirus. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to him,\u201d says Rivas, 32. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say: \u2018Hey, I hope you have a good journey.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a kid, Rivas hated photography because it reminded him of his dad. But as he grew older, he embraced it, recognizing the loving, if misguided, efforts his father had made to pass on his artform to him. To work through his grief, Rivas found himself returning to the camera, projecting images of his dad onto the walls of his house and then photographing himself next to them. He started thinking about how so many people had idolized his own father\u2019s drinking when he was growing up in Mexico and wondered what it might mean to picture healthy men and fathers. He started asking close family and friends, like the Mexica rapper Xiutezcatl, if they knew what a good Indigenous father looked like. Everyone he asked said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d So he started asking women in his network: \u201cHey, who do you think is a great father?\u201d That\u2019s how he connected with Manny Lieras, 43, of the Navajo and Comanche and the three other Indigenous men pictured in this series: Joshuaa Allison-Burbank, 33, of the Navajo Nation and Acoma Pueblo, Anthony \"Thosh\" Collins, 39, of the Onk-Akimel O\u2019odham/Wa-zha-zhi/Haudenosaunee and Daniel Santollo, 31, of the Pur\u00e9pecha and Mexica.\n\nAs I interviewed Rivas and these four men, I thought about my own father. All of us, in our own way, are working to undo cycles of trauma whipped up by colonization, and to reclaim communicative and healthy Indigenous households and identities.\n\nManny Lieras\u2019 eight-year-old daughter, Joni, was watering two pots of planted beans set out on her parent\u2019s Oakland, California apartment balcony with a gallon bottle of Crystal Geyser, when I came over to visit for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Her six-year-old little sister Lynn, who we all call \u201cLynnie,\u201d was playing in the living room. Bills rested on the table. The faint smell of leftover cheese pizza hung in the air. Lieras, who\u2019s 6-foot-2, 290 pounds, \u201csolid, like a mountain,\u201d gave me a big hug when I walked in the door and then plopped himself down at the kitchen table, where he could keep his left eye on Joni and his right ear on Lynnie as we caught up.\n\nI\u2019ve known Lieras for 17 years, since I was 11 and he was 26. We met at the powwow drum and dance practice held every Thursday night at the Oakland Intertribal Friendship House (IFH), one of the oldest urban Indian community centers in the country. My mom, who is white, started bringing me to IFH after my father, an alcoholic artist from the Secwepemc and St\u2019at\u2019imc First Nations who are indigenous to what\u2019s now British Columbia, Canada, divorced her to chase drink and fame and to start a new family in New Mexico when I was a little boy. I had my \u201ccoming out\u201d\u2014an initiation into the powwow circle\u2014when I was 11, the same year Lieras started showing up at IFH on Thursday nights. He\u2019s a talker\u2014and a singer\u2014with a voice so booming he can drown out all the other guys sitting at the drum.\n\nWhen I was a precocious teenager and Lieras was a youth worker with a lot of Indian side hustles (mostly singing gigs) we would occasionally road trip to powwows together. Back in those days, he says he had a lot of \u201cscheming behaviors.\u201d He\u2019s never elaborated on what exactly he means by that. As men, we\u2019re still not the best at that sort of communication. All he says is that whatever he was doing almost kept him from his wife Yvonne and his kids. I know that, in my own way, I was a bit of a schemer too. And for me, that looked like self-absorption. An obsession with good grades, powwow dancing championships and success. The desire for girls to like me, even if I was already with one. And various affection and praise-seeking habits intended to numb the wounds left by my father\u2019s absence. There was also self-pitying and self-destructive tendencies designed to rub salt in those same wounds, to torture myself for his departure, which, deep down, I believed was my own fault. When your own blood\u2014your parent\u2014leaves you, isn\u2019t it because, on some level, you weren\u2019t good enough? Not deserving of their love?\n\nWe\u2019d never talked about this either, but seated at the kitchen table, Lieras finally told me about his Mexican American dad Nayo, who, like my father, was mostly out of the picture. To explain their relationship, he tipped up his Urban Native Era snapback cap to show me the scar above his left eyebrow, received on one of his court-ordered visitation days when one of his two brothers accidentally smacked him with a baseball bat. Lieras remembers the blood pouring out of his noggin, but even more, he remembers his father\u2019s fury. How he scolded and then beat his brother. Lieras\u2019 parents split when he was three years old but his dad didn\u2019t try to get any sort of custody or visitation rights to his boys until Lieras was eight. He always felt like his dad didn\u2019t have any follow through. And even when he did, he would mess things up. On those visitation days, for example, Nayo would bring his kids over to his parents\u2019 house, which was filled with cats. Lieras is allergic.\n\nLieras doesn\u2019t totally blame his father for being the way he was and sees his old man as part of a broader cycle of machismo and of fathers not knowing how to love their kids. As Lieras got older, and more physically imposing, Nayo gave him and his brothers more respect. The discipline subsided. When Lieras went off to college at San Diego State University, he learned more about his mother\u2019s Navajo and Comanche roots. He also took up singing and joined the Native student group on campus in a push to change the school\u2019s mascot from the \u201cAztecs.\u201d Nayo is a Chicano guy who paints and does body work on cars. Activism isn\u2019t exactly his thing. But he heard his son out, and even defended his son\u2019s perspectives to the other guys at the auto shop. Maybe Nayo, like many of our fathers, is still learning.\n\nWhen his own father got old, Nayo took care for him: getting him out of bed, cleaning his sores and changing his briefs without the old man ever uttering the words \u201cthank you,\u201d or \u201cI love you.\u201d Lieras hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he crashed a little brotherly get together on the beach in San Diego a few years ago. But in May 29, Nayo wished his middle son a happy birthday on the right day for the first time.\n\nMany fathers in Indian Country see a clear link between abandoned kids, absent dads and the colonization of this continent and its First Peoples. In living memory, throughout North America, Native children were kidnapped from their families and taken to schools where they were forced to convert to Christianity and assimilate into white-dominant culture. Because of this history, Lieras and his wife Yvonne homeschool their daughters. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want them to be uneducated in all the things being presented as truth in the K-12 educational system,\u201d Lieras says. Until 2017, for example, all California fourth graders were required to build models of the Spanish missions where, beginning in 1769, California Indians were relocated, conscripted to labor and converted to Catholicism. By the time California became a state in 1848, missions had reduced the coastal Native population by 90 percent, according to the Encyclopedia of North American Indians. Few people know these histories today, and even fewer grapple with them.\n\nThe week before our chat, the bodies of 215 children, some as young as three, were found in unmarked graves at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Canada, where my grandmother earned her nursing degree. In Canada, people wore orange T-shirts as part of a solidarity movement with the Indigenous. In the states, some Native Americans tried to get others to do the same, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere. \u201cHere we are again, Natives just screaming into the void,\u201d Lieras says, summarizing the conversation as he saw it on social media.\n\nJoni had been out on the balcony watering the potted beans for a hot minute, when, out of his left eye, Lieras surmised she needed a little fatherly direction. \u201cDid you get all the top wet?\u201d he asked his elder daughter.\n\n\u201cHow come it looks dry from here? Keep going, then add the beans.\u201d\n\nAllison-Burbank is a licensed speech pathologist who works at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. He\u2019s the father of two: Kaleb, who\u2019s 10, and Kateri, who\u2019s five and starts Kindergarten in the fall. He decided to become a speech pathologist because he believes that communication and kinship are the basis for community. He strives to provide a loving environment for his children, bringing them back from the city in Albuquerque to his Navajo family\u2019s traditional six-acre field planted with corn, beans and squash on the San Juan River in Waterflow, New Mexico. He\u2019s teaching his kids how to care for the corn and how to grind it into a meal to make offerings to the Holy People. And he\u2019s also holding space for himself to navigate the kaleidoscopic collision of traditional life with reservation hardship and the demands of a career. With Thosh Collins, he\u2019s formed Indigenous men\u2019s groups where they can talk about those experiences and challenges, as well as the traumas that boil up through the seams of those worlds and into everyday life. He thinks those men\u2019s groups are essential. \u201cYou provide a space,\u201d he says. \u201cEquality and equitable opportunity for men trying to improve themselves and all the things that colonization has influenced and impacted.\u201d\n\nAllison-Burbank and Collins wrote a book chapter about fatherhood, childhood and early development. But while his Navajo and Acoma friend is a doctor of speech and the mind, Collins is an expert on the body. Over the last decade he has become perhaps the most influential fit Native dude on social media, a platform he\u2019s used to inspire Indigenous peoples to lead healthy, active and spiritual lives. Collins says his father drank when he was younger, but he got sober and raised his children in men\u2019s singing and ceremonial groups. Like his dad, Collins hunts: elk, mule deer, javelina, rabbit, quail. He grows corn and squash on his family\u2019s land. And he credits these traditions\u2014not just the cultural ones, but the dietary and athletic ones too\u2014for preparing him for fatherhood. He has two daughters now: a three-year-old and a six-month-old. The toddler often hangs out with him in his home gym while he works out, playing with her own toy kettle bell. And even though they\u2019re both girls, Collins intends to teach them all the things he would teach an Achimel O\u2019odham boy, including the songs historically reserved for men. While traditions need to be restored and maintained, he believes that sometimes they might also have to adapt and change. He lives much of his life by a three-word mantra, which, I imagine might be emblazoned on the wall of his gym someday: Revitalize, Preserve, Evolve. \u201cParenting is an opportunity to implement that,\u201d he said, \u201can opportunity to heal the trauma that has been put upon us\u2014not just to heal but to thrive.\u201d\n\nBut to thrive you need to know yourself and your place. And that\u2019s what Daniel Santollo has been working on the last five or so years, since former President Donald Trump started calling Mexicans rapists, thugs and criminals. Santollo immigrated to Oregon from a rancho in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n when he was nine. Not long after he arrived, he remembers playing outside his apartment with his brother. Some other people in the neighborhood came by and started calling them \u201cbeaners,\u201d and telling them to \u201cgo back to Mexico.\u201d As an adult, the experience of being labeled an unwanted \u201calien\u201d renewed Santollo\u2019s interest in a bit of family history that his aunt Lupe had maintained but that his Catholic family had shunned: their Indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha roots.\n\nOver the last few years, Santollo has learned more about this inheritance. He and his wife Carina, who\u2019s also from Michoac\u00e1n, gave their third child Tahiel a second name in the Indigenous Nahuatl language: Yaotl, which means \u201cwarrior\u201d because he survived a tough pregnancy. After Yaotl\u2019s birth, Santollo, his wife, and his three kids joined the Aztec dancer community in Portland. \u201cThey fell in love with it just like we did,\u201d Santollo said of his kids. \u201cAs soon as they heard the drum, it was calling to them.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when Native men were either vilified or lionized as \u201cwarriors\u201d or \u201cchiefs\u201d waging courageous, doomed and crazy insurgencies on the far side of the frontier of civilization. Sometimes we still feel like we have to embody the macho prowess of Sitting Bull, Geronimo and Tecumseh. I remember during one of his visits, when he was deep in the bottle, my dad told me the cops could never catch him speeding or slipping because he had \u201cCrazy Horse Medicine.\u201d After one night at the bar in Red Lodge, Montana, he took on the police with a buck knife. They tased him and charged him with a felony.\n\nMy dad\u2019s a big guy, but Lieras is so big he makes my dad look scrawny. And his take on what he calls the \u201cleader men\u201d in the Native pantheon is a bit different than the elder NoiseCat\u2019s: What if they ran and fought and persisted with so much ferocity because they loved their families so fiercely?\n\n\u201cWhat were the traits and characteristics and roles of fathers pre-colonization?\u201d Lieras asks. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like anybody\u2019s really studying that or talking about that.\u201d He continues: \u201cI know that some of the chiefs in our tribe, like Chief Manuelito, had a bunch of kids, you know, but you never hear about the relationship between them and their kids. You only hear about the relationship between them and the United States government.\u201d\n\nWhen he talks to his daughters, or to the children he mentors at the American Indian Child Resource Center, Lieras tries to get on their level, to make his enormous stature less intimidating. When Yvonne was first pregnant, and fatherhood was terrifying, he would sing to Joni in the womb. (Like Santollo\u2019s kids, Joni and Lynnie are both dancers now.)\n\nAs a parent and teacher, Lieras tries to foster a safe space for his kids to learn their language, history and culture, and to learn all sorts of practical and Indian skills, like how to cook, plant, swim, fish, horseback ride, canoe and, perhaps most importantly: communicate. He doesn\u2019t want his girls to be scared to say what they need. And he wants them to have great childhoods with a father who\u2019s present. Recently, he found himself looking at a picture taken at the San Francisco Giants Native American Heritage Night, a few years back. Yvonne and Joni were dancing. Lieras was singing with Lynnie strapped to his chest \u201clike a Daddy Kangaroo.\u201d As he reminisced, I thought I caught the seed of a tear in his eye.",

And his take on what he calls the \u201cleader men\u201d in the Native pantheon is a bit different than the elder NoiseCat\u2019s: What if they ran and fought and persisted with so much ferocity because they loved their families so fiercely?\n\n\u201cWhat were the traits and characteristics and roles of fathers pre-colonization?\u201d Lieras asks.",

            "content": "Welcome to Corridors. I'm your host, Nick Taylor-Vaisey. This week, the contrarian view from an overheated bubble of election speculation. Plus, prominent Conservatives line up behind embattled Green leader Annamie Paul. And Mark Carney is out \u2014 for now.\n\nRISKY BUSINESS \u2014 Ask a seasoned pol about the chances of an election this fall, and the word inevitable is on the tip of their tongue (as Corridors explored earlier this summer). But campaign vets slap a majority-sized asterisk on any talk of a vote. Every election call, says anyone who\u2019s run the gauntlet, risks everything.\n\nOnly one in four Canadians told pollster Nik Nanos they want a fall election. Thirty-seven percent were downright upset about the prospect. Food for thought if you're a prime minister who wants a second majority government.\n\nLet\u2019s run through some of the risks, which may even convince you an election isn\u2019t in the offing:\n\nChange is the rule: The horse-race polls haven't shifted considerably in several months. But Mike Moffatt, an economist who spent part of the Trudeau era as Canada's chief innovation fellow, reminds his followers that most recent elections weren't boring. A campaign with no meaningful movement in the polls \u2014 say, 2008 \u2014 is the exception. Stephen Harper came back to beat Paul Martin in 2006. Jack Layton defied the odds in 2011. And the Liberals vaulted from bronze medal to the top of the podium in 2015.\n\nThe polls are a bit shaky: Sure, the Liberals have topped every snapshot since February 2020, when a pre-pandemic Angus Reid poll had the Tories up by eight points. But that shop's most recent poll has Trudeau up by just two points nationally and four in Ontario, and the last two Leger polls show tightening races.\n\nA majority is not guaranteed: Even small variations in national polling shifts matter. Philippe J. Fournier, the brains behind 338Canada, maintains a voting simulator based on different results. The latest Angus Reid numbers give the Liberals a slim minority: 144 seats to 130 for the Tories, 40 for the NDP, 23 for the Bloc and a single seat for the Greens. (Try out the simulator yourself.) Where in Canada are you watching most closely? Flip an email to Nick.\n\nFear of a fourth wave: Canadians might be feeling more optimistic as vaccinations surge, their favorite restaurants reopen, and they can gather with friends and family. But a senior NDP source stated the obvious about a prospective spike in Covid cases along the lines of the U.K. experience this summer.\n\nThe quote: \u201cIf you are the sitting government that calls an election, and you don't need to, and you wind up with a fourth wave ... that's a bad scenario,\" said the source. \"Especially with an election that's going to look very opportunistic.\"\n\nMost insiders still wager the country is headed for the polls. But none say it's a slam dunk.\n\nRETIREMENT SAVINGS: Last month, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett slagged Jody Wilson-Raybould with an offensive text message that Wilson-Raybould called \"racist\" and \"misogynist.\" Bennett's missive appeared to imply that JWR, who was elected five years and nine months ago, was concerned that a summer election would mean she'd miss out on a parliamentary pension that kicks in after six years of service.\n\nNo one gets into politics for the pension, but Bennett's unseemly text did confirm they're talked about behind the scenes \u2014 especially by MPs who are edging closer to qualifying for payments as early as their 55th birthday. The Class of 2015 is eligible at the strike of midnight on Oct. 21.\n\nThe generous pension plan has for years preoccupied journalists (see: 2010, 2012, 2019, 2021). Its roots are arguably unimpeachable: MPs left stable livelihoods for the frenetic world of elected politics, and they should be rewarded for their service. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation crunched the numbers after the 2019 election. Orange Wave New Democrats who'd served 8.5 years netted annual pensions worth more than C$40,000.\n\n\u2014 All of which to say: 92 Liberal MPs who were first elected in 2015 have more to lose than a seat \u2014 not to mention 50 MPs from other parties.\n\nNOMINATION CENSUS: POLITICO\u2019s Zi-Ann Lum is keeping count as Canada\u2019s major parties secure their candidates. Here are the standings, with any change since last week in parentheses.\n\nThe immigration minister was the luckiest Liberal in the land last week when he broke the news on a Toronto Blue Jays broadcast that Canada's only major league baseball team scored a national interest exemption to return home on July 30 after playing a season and a half in Buffalo and Dunedin, Florida. Critics will dismiss Mendicino as an opportunist who timed his decision to a potential election. But do Jays fans want to know the terrifying truth? Or do they just want to watch their guys sock some dingers?\n\nManitoba's minister of Indigenous reconciliation and northern relations, a M\u00e9tis man, was less than an hour into his new job before he told reporters that residential school operators \"thought they were doing the right thing.\" NDP leader Wab Kinew, the son of a survivor, crashed the presser and dressed down Lagimodiere. The portfolio needed a new minister when Eileen Clarke resigned after Premier Brian Pallister made his own controversial remarks about reconciliation. Lagimodiere apologized, but couldn't control the fallout.\n\nSCREENSHOT OF THE WEEK \u2014 Green leader Annamie Paul is still mired in the aftermath of party infighting. Elizabeth May finally pledged support for her successor after a prolonged silence, but it's unclear how united the party is after weeks of strife.\n\nPaul tweeted Tuesday that the feds were excluding her from a summit on antisemitism to be held today. She found support from an influential Conservative and a certain former Liberal who has a bone to pick with the prime minister. Rona Ambrose is also on Team Annamie.\n\nBIDEN BILAT \u2014 Trudeau formally announced the date that vaccinated non-Canadians can travel to Canada. Americans are free to cross on Aug. 9, and the rest of the world can join a month later. The opening won't yet go both ways. As POLITICO\u2019s Andy Blatchford reports, U.S. President Joe Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said she \"wouldn\u2019t look at it through a reciprocal intention.\"\n\nBut even if it's a one-way thing, surely Biden could fly north for his first official trip as soon as Aug. 9. Maybe in the leadup to, say, an election call?\n\nOTTAWA CENTRE OF ATTENTION \u2014 So much for the breathless 24/7 focus on Mark Carney's electoral prospects. The central banker was widely rumored to be prepping for an Ottawa-area run, and his name was tossed about in Catherine McKenna's riding, Karen McCrimmon's seat in Kanata-Carleton and even David McGuinty's perch in the south end. (Almost anywhere but Ottawa-Vanier, where he actually lives.) But Carney won't run this time, he says, because he's focusing on the U.N. climate conference that runs Oct. 31 until Nov. 12.\n\n\u2014 Save the date: Carney did reassert his support for Trudeau's Liberals \"and will do everything [he] can to help\" them win. He also didn't rule out a future run. So if Canada hasn't voted by Nov. 13, when Carney's schedule might be a bit clearer, speculators can restart the clock on the central banker's political debut.\n\n\u2014 Last man standing: Back in the riding of Ottawa Centre, where one hardened politico quipped to Corridors that politics is local, provincial, national and international, it'll be hard for anybody to beat Yasir Naqvi. The former MPP and attorney general, who represented the same riding at Queen's Park for 11 years, signaled his intent to enter the race for the federal Ottawa Centre nomination a few days after McKenna's presser.\n\nHe hasn't filed his nomination papers (the party hasn't made them available), and he's game for an open contest. But any non-Liberals who hoped for a battle between a member of the global elite and a popular local rep will have to wait. (The NDP was surely savoring a showdown between Carney and their local candidate, CUPE economist Angella MacEwen.)\n\nMILLSTONE TO MILESTONE \u2014 Liberal Twitter recently unearthed a November 2020 tweet from Don Davies, the NDP's health critic. Davies was asking reasonable questions of the Liberals, who had yet to release vaccine distribution plans or contracts. The theme of the dunk-a-thon: \"This didn't age well.\" After all, the government did recover from a sluggish start to deliver on its vaccine promises. Canada did this week pass the U.S. in global rankings, where hesitancy is a bigger problem. And 72 percent of the country is happy with the Liberal rollout.\n\n\u2014 Big question marks: One of the turning points in Canada's mass vaccination campaign was a decision to mix vaccines. Many Canadians received a combination of doses \u2014 Pfizer then Moderna, for example. But some cruise lines have said they won't accept passengers who mixed doses. Millions of Canadians received the AstraZeneca shot, which for a time barred them from a Bruce Springsteen show on Broadway (if they could get across the border).\n\nA frenetic six-month campaign to inoculate an entire nation might have been a world-leading achievement, but Canadians are now confronting a helter skelter mishmash of rules and regulations at home and around the world. Policymakers will have to respond with clarity.\n\nThis week, Corridors asks: As more Canadians are vaccinated, and we slowly reacquaint ourselves with real-life interaction, how are MPs engaging with their constituents?\n\nInitially, it was a lot of phone calls, then Zoom. But now the restrictions are being lifted to a great extent, I'm able to meet constituents in-person. People are really eager to be out and about. I had a Stampede Breakfast last week, and I had about 700 people show up. So engagement with constituents evolved and changed with the times.\n\nDoor knocking happens in the evenings. You gauge your audience. I ask people if they're comfortable shaking hands. Sometimes, people will invite me into their house. I put my mask on and remain in their entryway. I also carry hand sanitizer. We're looking at our constituents and what they're comfortable with.\n\nThis riding is gigantic. It's the size of Poland, and comprises the top left corner of British Columbia. In the past, the majority of outreach was done in-person. Often, you'd travel an entire day to spend half a day in a community. And that's on top of commuting back and forth to Ottawa.\n\nOne of the silver linings of Covid has been it expanded our use of these remote communications tools. We had some great success engaging people from all across the region, all at once, which we hadn't really been able to do before. We held town halls on topics like food security and Covid safety and other topics.\n\nPeople have grown fatigued by being online so much, especially as the weather gets better. But those tools, and the fact we all know how to use them now, is something I'm hoping we can retain moving forward.\n\nI'm noticing a lot of service clubs doing drive-through events. Talking to fairs or festivals who are opening up, they mention two challenges. One is the logistics of putting together an event in a month or two, when normally they'd be planning for the better part of a year. The second thing is their sponsorship levels. They rely on a lot of businesses to help with donations, and some had been impacted by the pandemic.\n\nMy predecessor, Guy Lauzon, had a perfect spot geographically for a big community picnic. He and his wife hosted it in their backyard every summer. I live in a condo, so I don't think my condo board would appreciate 400 people showing up. But we're doing a series of neighborhood barbecues. That allows us to keep numbers lower and safer.\n\nWe are aware that there's still a population that's not vaccinated. There's still young children who are not vaccinated. There's a Delta variant, and probably some unknown variants out there. When we moved into this new office, we didn't have a chance to have an office opening. We\u2019re now looking to late August or early September to do a community barbecue at a local park, to get a chance to meet some of the neighbors.\n\nPeople are coming out of deep isolation, and there's going to have to be a reestablishment of what community looks like outside of social media and Zoom meetings.\n\nI still can't see myself canvassing door to door. I don't know that that would be seen as acceptable in southern Ontario. There's even a weirdness around shaking hands, and being too close to people without a mask.\n\nCorridors is a new weekly newsletter for MPs, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\u2019s going on around Parliament Hill. Every Wednesday we will look at the people pulling the levers of power in Ottawa and the questions that are influencing decisions on Parliament Hill and in the provinces. Join the conversation!
