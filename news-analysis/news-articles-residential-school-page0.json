Boys pray on bunk beds in a dormitory at the Bishop Horden Memorial School, a residential school in the indigenous Cree community of Moose Factory, Ontario, Canada in 1950. Between 1831 and 1996, Canada's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 children from their homes.

            "content": "A branch of Canada\u2019s federal police force says it has spent the last decade conducting a \u201clarge-scale investigation\u201d into allegations of sexual abuse at a former residential school.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it launched a criminal investigation in 2011, investigating claims that students were assaulted during their time at the Fort Alexander residential school.\n\nThe rare disclosure of an ongoing investigation was prompted by questions from the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper.\n\n\u201cDue to the many people affected by this investigation as well as the larger social implications, it was determined to be in the public interest to provide as much information on the ongoing investigation as we can,\u201d the RCMP said in its news release.\n\nAt least 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools across the country, which were funded by the federal government and run by churches as part of the campaign to strip the youth of their cultural identity.\n\nThe Fort Alexander residential school, 125km (78 miles) north-east of Winnipeg, opened in 1905. Children often tried to run away from the institution, according to the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre. In 1928, two boys drowned while trying to escape by boat.\n\nIt was closed by the federal government in 1970. Elders have long spoken about abuse within the institution, including testifying at the country\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission.\n\nMore than 80 RCMP officers have been involved in the investigation so far, which has involved speaking to more than 700 people across North America.\n\nInvestigators travelled to Ottawa to scour archival records from the school, as well as the province of Manitoba\u2019s records. They also canvassed residents in the area where the school was located, on the grounds of the Sagkeeng First Nation.\n\nGrand chiefs of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Southern Chiefs\u2019 Organization have worked closely with police on the investigation, as have the chief and council of the Sagkeeng First Nation.\n\nIn addition to testimony of abuse, survivors have long said children went missing or died while attending the school.\n\nLast week, teams searched the grounds of Sagkeeng First Nation using a drone and ground-penetrating radar technology to look for human remains.\n\nTo date, more than 1,300 unmarked graves have been discovered on the grounds of former schools, prompting a national reckoning over Canada\u2019s colonial past.",

            "content": "Canada and Catholic Church have done little to atone for forced-assimilation institutions, say experts who demand concrete action.\n\nWarning: The story below contains details of residential schools that may be upsetting. Canada\u2019s Indian Residential School Survivors and Family Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day at 1-866-925-4419.\n\nCanada \u2013 Niigaanwewidam Sinclair says the recent discoveries of mass graves of Indigenous children have vindicated what his community has long known.\n\n\u201cEvery Indigenous community has stories of lost children, so none of this is surprising,\u201d Sinclair, associate professor at the University of Manitoba, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe only surprising element really is that Canadians are so surprised.\u201d\n\nAt least three First Nations in Canada recently uncovered hundreds of unmarked graves of Indigenous children on the grounds of former \u201cresidential schools\u201d \u2013 government-founded, assimilation institutions that were run by various churches for more than 100 years.\n\nFrom the late 1800s until 1996, Canada forcibly removed 150,000 Indigenous children from their families and forced them to attend the institutions. They were made to cut their long hair, forbidden from speaking their languages, and many were physically and sexually abused. Thousands are believed to have died.\n\nFor decades, survivors have known of their deaths, but now with more access to technology, the graves are being examined. As First Nations publicise the exact numbers of lost children, a wave of grief has crashed through Indigenous communities.\n\nThe findings have also fuelled calls for accountability from Ottawa and the churches that ran day-to-day operations at the institutions \u2013 notably the Roman Catholic Church, which was in charge of most of them.\n\nBut Indigenous leaders say neither the federal government nor the Catholic Church have done enough to address continuing harms caused by the institutions \u2013 nor have they acted to implement a long list of recommendations put out by a federal commission of inquiry in 2015. That commission concluded Canada had committed \u201ccultural genocide\u201d through the residential schools system.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a plan, they don\u2019t have the means or the political will to deliver on the small amount of initiatives that they\u2019ve committed to, and if anything, they\u2019ve disappointed widely on the commitments they make. Their words don\u2019t match their actions,\u201d said Sinclair, referring to the Canadian government.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was envisioned as a way to document the stories of residential school survivors and bring them justice, but years after the TRC issued its calls to action, Canada and the Catholic Church have only implemented eight of 94 recommendations, a December 2020 report by the First-Nation-led research centre, the Yellowhead Institute, found.\n\nHowever, as graves of Indigenous children were counted over the last month, Canada has made progress on four more, said Eva Jewell, associate fellow at the Yellowhead Institute, who co-authored the report, although she cautioned that it is not clear if those four have been fully implemented yet.\n\n\u201cCanada can summon the political will when there\u2019s heat on them,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on Canada to act and to do something, and suddenly there\u2019s been a renewed interest in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s calls to action. They\u2019ve been neglected for so long, and suddenly here was this finding, and Canadians were rushing to figure out, \u2018well, I thought we were doing something.'\u201d\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada told Al Jazeera in an email this month that the country\u2019s 2019 budget provided $28m ($33.8m Canadian) over three years to support the recommendations on deaths at the schools specifically. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ministers have reiterated that they remain committed to supporting First Nation communities in their efforts.\n\nBut Indigenous advocates say too little has been done, and Jewell said the existing dynamic puts pressure on Indigenous people to take action when a tragedy makes headlines.\n\n\u201cThere was no time to mourn, there was no time to sit with the grief, it was just an immediate spring to action and seize the moment, and try to harness the attention and the political will to push through the things that really matter, and that will really affect change in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to see more sustained commitment and action, and I hope Canadians will commit to that.\u201d\n\nThe TRC\u2019s calls to action include an apology from Pope Francis for the role the Catholic Church played in the residential schools system, and aid from the federal government to help uncover unmarked graves and identify remains.\n\nBut the pope has not apologised, expressing \u201cpain\u201d this month after 215 Indigenous children were found in unmarked graves at Kamloops Indian Residential School in the western province of British Columbia. Weeks later, some 715 Indigenous people\u2019s remains were discovered at Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. Both institutions were run by the Catholic Church, furthering calls for the church to hand over all of its records.\n\n\u201cThe Church needs to accept full responsibility, release all its Indian Residential School records, and trade in shallow placatory remarks for meaningful apologies through action,\u201d Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, said in a statement.\n\nDonald Bolen, the Archbishop of Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan, said the archdiocese has limited residential school records. But he said death records from 1885 to 1952 were handed over to Cowessess First Nation, which discovered the unmarked graves at Marieval. The archdiocese also has some correspondence outlining when many priests began working at residential schools in that area, Bolen told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWithin the limits of privacy laws, we\u2019re sharing what we have and we\u2019ll assist Indigenous communities with communications with religious communities who might have more information,\u201d he said, adding that the archdiocese also provided $70,000 in 2019 to help the First Nation in its search for the unmarked graves.\n\nMeanwhile, two religious communities of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate \u2013 which operated both the Marieval and Kamloops institutions \u2013 said on June 24 that they would \u201cdisclose all historical documents maintained by us and in our possession, in accordance with all legislation, about our involvement\u201d.\n\nBolen would not comment directly when asked why Pope Francis has not yet apologised. He said an Indigenous delegation would travel to Rome before the end of the year to meet with the pope. \u201cThe pope will have a chance to hear from them directly and then to engage,\u201d Bolen said. \u201cThat process is really vital.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the residential school discoveries have garnered international condemnation, including from a panel of United Nations experts who on June 4 called for \u201cfull-fledged investigations\u201d of the grave site at Kamloops.\n\nMurray Sinclair, the former chair of the TRC, also recently told The Globe and Mail newspaper that any investigation \u201cshould not be left in the hands of the government or the churches and must instead be created in consultation with Indigenous people\u201d.\n\nTrudeau was asked during a news conference on June 25 how far his government would be willing to go to get accountability, including whether police or international experts should investigate. \u201cI think the first thing we need to do is be there for the communities and what they want, and what they need, and what answers they need to get,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cEvery step of the way, my pledge to all Canadians is that we will put Indigenous peoples and their wishes \u2013 for their loved ones, for their communities \u2013 at the very core of whatever next steps we take.\u201d\n\nMelanie Klinkner, associate professor at Bournemouth University and expert on mass graves, said two elements stand out in the residential schools discoveries: the circumstances of the children\u2019s deaths and the potential unlawfulness in how their bodies were disposed of.\n\nShe said states have a duty to conduct \u201ca full and effective investigation\u201d when suspicious deaths are reported. \u201cThe investigation needs to be independent, it needs to be impartial, it needs to be done in such a way that there\u2019s confidence in the findings. It also means that they must be capable of resulting in accountability processes,\u201d Klinkner told Al Jazeera.\n\nKlinkner added that other forms of justice also are at play in Canada, including the identification, return and reburial of the Indigenous children\u2019s remains in a culturally sensitive manner, potential historical commemorations at the sites, and support for residential school survivors. \u201cThe onus is on the government to uphold the rule of law,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is why I think an investigation has to happen.\u201d\n\nSinclair at the University of Manitoba said for Canada to properly atone for its genocide, it must return the land to Indigenous people, recognise treaty rights, and adopt a long-term plan to implement the TRC calls to action, as well as the recommendations in a report on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to create a country different than that which we have inherited,\u201d he said.",

Meanwhile, the residential school discoveries have garnered international condemnation, including from a panel of United Nations experts who on June 4 called for \u201cfull-fledged investigations\u201d of the grave site at Kamloops.\n\nMurray Sinclair, the former chair of the TRC, also recently told The Globe and Mail newspaper that any investigation \u201cshould not be left in the hands of the government or the churches and must instead be created in consultation with Indigenous people\u201d.",

            "description": "Residential School Survivors Tell Us What Intergenerational Trauma Really Is  VICE",
            "content": "But the horrors didn\u2019t end there; they\u2019ve lasted for generations. In a moving testimony published by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which investigated Canada\u2019s residential school system and its ongoing legacy, a Kuper Island survivor told how residential schools have had a devastating reach that\u2019s extended well beyond school grounds. The Residential School System Didn\u2019t End\u2014It Just Became Foster Care \u201cMy parents went to residential school system, and they didn\u2019t know how to parent and suffered from alcoholism. There was physical abuse at home, just the chaos of an alcoholic home,\u201d the survivor said. Various degrees of disrupted family life are examples of the intergenerational consequences caused by residential schools, the TRC confirmed. Intergenerational trauma, as it\u2019s widely referred to, is complicated because it can manifest in several ways. Intergenerational trauma, also known as generational or transgenerational trauma, happens \u201cwhen the stressful and traumatic experiences faced by one generation impact the health, well-being, and experiences of the next generation,\u201d said Dalhousie University professor Amy Bombay, who\u2019s studied intergenerational effects of residential schools and is a member of Rainy River First Nations. It also explains how news of unmarked graves at former residential schools has often been triggering or distressing not only for survivors but also for their families. In May, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation confirmed that 215 unmarked graves of children were buried at a former residential school, although that number has since changed to 200. Other sites like it have already been confirmed\u2014with many more expected.\n\nThe Canadian government, along with churches, the majority of them Catholic, ran residential schools to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children\u2014to \u201ckill the Indian in the child,\u201d a famous phrase endorsed by several residential school architects, including Canada\u2019s first prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Physical and sexual abuses were common, as were malnutrition and disease. Thousands of children were killed, while others were left with incomprehensible trauma. The system has been called genocide. The trauma didn\u2019t just afflict the children forced to attend; it also afflicted parents who had their children taken away as well as the children of survivors, and communities, said Marlene McNab, a N\u00eahi\u00fdawak citizen of the George Gordon First Nation in Saskatchewan, assistant professor at the First Nations University of Canada, and an Indigenous social work expert. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about multiple generations that had this shock, trauma experience,\u201d said McNab, who, along with her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents was forced to attend residential school. Intergenerational trauma was first coined after researchers noticed that children of Holocaust survivors were displaying signs of distress. A 1988 study in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, found that grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were 300 percent more likely than the general population to require psychiatric care.\n\nThe outcomes are not unique to Indigenous peoples. Every person who experiences chronic childhood abuse and trauma is at greater risk of a number of trauma responses, Bombay said. \u201cVirtually every negative social and psychological and physiological outcome has been linked to chronic childhood trauma,\u201d she said. What does intergenerational trauma look like? Trauma that\u2019s passed down can take on many forms: in its most extreme, it can result in parents abusing or neglecting their children the way they were abused or neglected. Traumatized people are also more likely to suffer from suicide, homelessness, and addiction\u2014outcomes that have been linked to residential schools and the foster care system. Intergenerational trauma can lead to anxiety, distress, low self-esteem, or depression in younger generations. As a small child, Ek-kanakii slept with her relatives most nights because they lived in a small home, often curling up with her grandma when she needed care. So when Ek-kanakii was a 6-year-old at Old Sun, an Anglica-run assimilative school in southern Alberta, she and her twin found their older sister, also at the school, and crawled into her bed at night\u2014they were scared and wanted comfort, just like at home.\n\nIn the morning, school staff found them and beat them. Years later, when Ek-kanakii had her own children, and then grandchildren, she felt it taboo to cuddle up with them. \u201cIt was hard to sleep with my kids and grandkids even though I know it\u2019s not bad, and my grandkids always want to sleep with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how the schools brainwashed you.\u201d Residential schools and other institutions actively prevented children from expressing their cultures and speaking in their languages. As a result, parents and peers sometimes passed on the shame they felt for being Indigenous to others. There Are Many Unmarked Graves of Indigenous Kids at US Boarding Schools Too One way they instilled shame at Old Sun, Ek-kanakii said, was by corralling the women in the showers, naked. While Ek-kanakii and her classmates washed themselves, matrons would stand around and watch while yelling degrading comments. If a girl was caught looking at another, she\u2019d be accused of being \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201chorny,\u201d she said. Later, older students started mirroring the matrons, often making similar comments to younger students. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve learned from childhood is what you teach your kids,\u201d Ek-kanakii said. While attending residential school in Canada in the early 1970s, McNab, who was 6, and other children were forced to wake up early on Saturdays and clean the building \u201cfrom top to bottom.\u201d They scrubbed, waxed, and polished the linoleum floors, and washed massive staircases that led up to the girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 dorms.\n\nBeds had to be made meticulously\u2014like in a military movie when a soldier bounces a quarter off the sheets in his barracks, McNab said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t, you had your bed stripped in front of everyone and you were forced to do it again. It was humiliating.\u201d Physical punishment was also common. After the cleaning was done, the kids would line up and get sweets. \u201cThe minute sugar hit our blood it was like, \u2018Yes, this is the reward,\u2019\u201d McNab said, \u201cOur drug to feel better.\u201d Fast forward to the 90s, McNab, no longer a student, had children of her own. She\u2019d wake them up every Saturday and get them to clean the house from \u201ctop to bottom,\u201d until they finished at about 2 p.m. Then, she\u2019d reward her kids with an allowance. The routine lasted years, with her oldest child doing it from the ages of 6 to about 12. \u201cI was a grouch. I was like, \u2018Do this over again.\u2019 I had a very driven type of energy about me,\u201d McNab said. \u201cI realized I passed that pattern along to my children.\u201d Lack of communication about residential schools and colonialism is another pathway for passing trauma down, according to Bombay. When parents opt out of sharing stories about their trauma, but children can sense it anyway, it can result in depressive symptoms in the children, Bombay said. \u201cWe need to research how to talk to the next generation about this in ways where we pass on the truth, but ways that are age-appropriate and aren\u2019t retraumatizing as much as possible,\u201d Bombay said. \u201cWe need to know about it and learn about it and understand how it fits into colonialism\u2026 But it also needs to be accompanied by resilience and strength and hope.\u201d\n\nMcNab, who had grappled with addiction as a result of residential school abuse, said she started healing in the early 1990s, when she was in her 20s; her university education, in particular, helped her come to terms with the past and openly discuss her residential school experience, something many others weren\u2019t comfortable doing. \u201cBy 24 I was clean and sober,\u201d McNab said, so she started to think intentionally about the harmful patterns she had learned at residential school\u2014like Saturday morning cleaning. \u201cI could wake up on a Saturday and be so happy, and once I moved to cleaning mode, my whole character changed,\u201d McNab said. \u201cIt was robbing me of my serenity and peace, and it was affecting my relationships with my kids.\u201d McNab cut the practice by the time she was 28, with her third child, and has since encouraged her kids and grandkids to avoid cleaning on Saturdays. \u201cI was like, \u2018Pick a different day; break the cycle,\u2019\u201d McNab said. \u201cYou can unlearn behaviours and I\u2019m pointing it out to my grandchildren so they don\u2019t have to carry that burden.\u201d People grappling with trauma break the intergenerational cycle all the time, whether we\u2019re talking about addiction or day-to-day routines. While trauma can be passed down through generations, so can healing. Today, when Ek-kanakii\u2019s grandchildren want to cuddle with her, they do. But Ek-kanakii said she\u2019s spent many years healing and reconnecting with Siksika ways to overcome behaviours pushed on her at Old Sun, which she attended until 1971.\n\n\u201cPeople have intergenerational resilience, too,\u201d said Sharon Foster, a mixed-Indigenous counselling therapist. \u201cI have the trauma, yes, but I also have the resilience, right? Because I\u2019m alive.\u201d Foster emphasized the need for Indigenous peoples to reconnect with their cultures, including their languages and ways of knowing and relating to the world. \u201cWhen you control language, you control the mind,\u201d Foster said. Ek-kanakii recalled the story of a Siksika woman who got angry and yelled at her children in English, only to have her dad walk in and, in Siksika, say, \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at my grandchildren again\u2026 But if you\u2019re going to get mad at them, get mad at them in our language.\u201d \u201cHe said that because you cannot get mad at kids in our language,\u201d Ek-kanakii said. \u201cThere are just no words to get mad at our kids.\u201d Learning Siksika language and teachings, and attending ceremonies, helped Ek-kanakii heal after experiencing the well-documented horrors at residential school. She credits her grandmother for holding onto culture and passing it down. \u201cMy grandma taught us well and if I didn\u2019t have that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here today,\u201d Ek-kanakii said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that we have done as a people to break cycles and get better and move forward and change things for generations that are here and the ones to come,\u201d McNab said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about celebrating where we\u2019re at today\u2026 I\u2019m so happy to see so many of our people embracing our Indigeneity.\u201d How can we fight intergenerational trauma? According to Bombay, a combination of Indigenous and Western approaches, including PTSD treatments, can combat intergenerational trauma. \u201cA lot of people describe using both, and some people who use both said it\u2019s the traditional approach that\u2019s been key,\u201d Bombay said, adding that rebuilding pride and belonging with your culture promotes positive outcomes and protects against negative ones. Foster said Western approaches to psychology have limitations because they focus on the mind and body, but \u201cdon\u2019t consider the spirit, which is everything for Indigenous people.\u201d Indigenous psychologist Eduardo Duran described the trauma colonialism has caused as a \u201csoul wound,\u201d she said. For Duran, the mind, body, and spirit connections have to be in harmony for the soul wound to heal. Ek-kanakii said Canada\u2019s Indian Residential Schools Resolution Health Support Program, which seeks to provide various supports to residential school survivors and their families, doesn\u2019t go far enough\u2014it mainly covers therapy from \u201celigible providers\u201d that have Western training and accreditation. The government needs to go beyond \u201cone-time funding for certain programs\u201d and commit to sustained programming that\u2019s culturally appropriate and Indigenous-led, Bombay said.\n\nSystems riddled with racism, including foster care, health care, and the courts, continue to harm Indigenous folks and disproportionately punish them for realities they did not cause in the first place. \u201cSocial and economic determinants that we Indigenous people experience across Canada and the world are attributed to the long-term effects of intergenerational trauma,\u201d McNab said. In Canada, Indigenous children make up about 8 percent of the population under 15, yet 52.2 percent of all kids in care. VICE World News previously reported how the foster care system is an extension of residential schools: many people who aged out of residential school re-entered their communities without having been taught child-rearing skills based on kinship and Indigenous knowledge. When social workers got involved, they again removed children from their communities, rather than fostering environments where communities could rebuild. Canada needs to own up, McNab said. \u201cFor healing to occur, it\u2019s really important to remember that the government is accountable. They need to be held accountable for the ongoing impacts of intergenerational trauma,\u201d McNab said, adding that non-Indigenous people need to address the anti-Indigenous racism plaguing institutions and, in many cases, their families. Since May, there\u2019s been a push, spearheaded by 15 Indigenous and non-Indigenous lawyers, for Canada to face trials for crimes against humanity and genocide for its role in residential schools. The International Criminal Court is currently considering whether to open an investigation. Criminally Charge Canada and the Catholic Church For Residential Schools: Experts When a person or community heals, it creates a ripple effect; healing for everyone else becomes easier. When Ek-kanakii was 18, no longer in residential school, her twin sister graduated from high school. \u201cI was dumbfounded,\u201d said Ek-kanakii, who had a child at the time. \u201cI said, \u2018How did you do that? We\u2019re supposed to be stupid!\u2019 That\u2019s how brainwashed we were.\u201d A guidance counsellor had told Ek-kanakii\u2019s twin that she could do whatever she wanted, so Ek-kanakii decided she could, too. Ek-kanakii became a social worker and teacher, and she\u2019s worked as a social worker, healer, teacher, and therapist since. \u201cMy education helped me heal; it was so powerful, loving myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my grandma\u2019s teachings came back and I was like, \u2018Hey, we aren\u2019t bad.\u2019\u201d Anyone experiencing distress or pain as a result of residential schools can call the Indian Residential School Survivors Society Crisis Line (1-866-925-4419).

(Photo by Mert Alper Dervis/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nIn a powerful statement Thursday, a residential school survivor said she and other survivors were repeatedly ignored whenever they spoke out about thousands of children who went missing after being forced to attend the schools.\n\n\u201cWe had tried to mention over and over and over that there are many children missing who did not reach home,\u201d said Evelyn Camille, who was forced to attend Kamloops Indian Residential School until the 50s. \u201cTruth and reconciliation, I often wondered what the hell does that mean?... Do they want to hear the truth? Really? We have tried to tell them the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cResidential schools were specifically built to take the Indian out of us; to take away our language, culture, and traditions,\u201d Camille said. \u201cBut it did not work\u2026 Our culture, language, and way of life is still with us. It'll always remain with us. Our children must know who we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it took science to wake people up,\u201d said Lisa Hodgetts, the president of the Canadian Archeological Association, considering Indigenous people have been exposing the realities of residential schools and colonialism for decades. The facts are already cemented in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s findings, published after an investigation into residential schools and their ongoing legacy.\n\nThe location near Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest in Canada\u2019s Indian Affairs system, was chosen because oral histories from knowledge keepers, as well as a juvenile rib bone and tooth found in the area, signalled the likely presence of unmarked graves, said Sarah Beaulieu, a ground penetrating radar specialist from University of the Fraser Valley who has worked with the First Nation throughout the investigation.\n\nWhile ground penetrating radar is not intended to give exact numbers and results\u2014forensic investigation with excavation will have to be used to get more specificity\u2014Beaulieu said that based on her experience and the information shared by knowledge keepers, she expects the presence of hundreds of unmarked graves in the area.\n\nGoing forward, Casimir said her community will review student records from Kamloops Indian Residential School. The onus is on the federal government and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the Catholic order that ran the institutions, to secure and share the records \u201copenly and fully,\u201d Casimir said.\n\n\u201cWe call on provincial and federal governments to provide immediate and ongoing funding as we develop and implement frameworks and processes to further identity, document, maintain, and protect the remains of the children found buried,\u201d she said.\n\nHer community is also seeking a healing centre that reflects Secw\u00e9pemc customs, and is pursuing an oral testimony project. Oral tellings from survivors have come forward from across the country willing to share information about deaths, missing children, unmarked graves, and more.\n\n\u201cThis is a crime against humanity; this is a crime against children. The UN has called this genocide. We call this genocide,\u201d said new Assembly of First Nations Chief RoseAnne Archibald. \u201cWe have always known from the very beginning (of residential schools) that many of our children did not return.\u201d",

            "content": "The remains of an estimated 751 Indigenous people, mostly children, were found buried at another former residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada, Cowessess First Nation confirmed on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a mass gravesite\u2014these are unmarked graves,\u201d Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme said at a press conference. \u201cWe are treating this like a crime scene at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t confirm they are all children, but there are oral stories that there are adults in this gravesite as well because it was the Roman Catholic Church that oversaw this site,\u201d Delorme said. \u201cWe always knew that there were graves here.\u201d\n\nThe community estimates 751 unmarked graves, but because there is still a margin of error in the investigation, there are definitely over 600, Delorme said, adding that it\u2019s likely that the 751 unmarked graves had signage at one point, before Catholic officials removed it.\n\nThe next steps include honouring the burial sites by marking and preserving them. \u201cThe more we put names to them the more we will reopen the pains,\u201d Delorme said. Every grave will be marked and a monument will eventually be put in place to commemorate the lost loved ones, Delorme said.\n\nResidential schools were run by the Canadian government and churches to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Sweeping sexual and physical abuses were common and thousands of children died. According to Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, about 4,100 students were killed, but that number is likely to climb. Experts think it\u2019s closer to 15,000.\n\nAs more sites are confirmed, the news supports what Indigenous people have been saying about residential schools for decades, and many more remains are expected in Canada and the U.S.\n\nThis was a crime against humanity,\u201d said Bobby Cameron, chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN), which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan. \u201cThe only crime we committed as children was being born Indigenous...We had concentration camps here. We had them here in Saskatchewan. They were called Indian residential schools.\u201d\n\nCameron said the government and the Catholic Church need to hand over any records, so that information about who died at residential schools as well as those who ran residential schools can be uncovered. Cameron also said Pope Francis needs to apologize, something the Catholic Church has not done yet.\n\n\u201cAn apology is one step of many in the healing journey,\u201d he said. \u201cIndigenous people in this country are survivors and now the descendants are still in an intergenerational trauma stage for some.\u201d\n\nThe legacy of residential schools continues to this day through foster care and prisons, where Indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented, experts say. Delorme acknowledged this reality and asked everyone to listen and stand by communities as more stories like this surface.\n\nCameron said all institutions that abused, tortured, and murdered Indigenous peoples need to be searched. \u201cWe will tell the stories to our children of the people who died,\u201d Cameron said, adding that this news can be triggering, so support is available for those who need it.\n\nMuskowekwan First Nation, a community about one and a half hours north of Regina, Saskatchewan, confirmed earlier this month it found the remains of 35 undocumented children at the site of former residential school Muscowequan and Touchwood. Another 35 unmarked graves were found at the former Regina Industrial School, as confirmed by the Regina Indian Industrial School Commemorative Association, an organization that cares for the cemetery at the site.",

            "content": "Classroom at the former Kuper Island Indian Industrial School, which ran from 1890 to the 1970s. (Indian Residential School History & Dialogue Centre via National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation)\n\nA First Nation in Canada has confirmed another 160 unmarked graves\u2014possibly more\u2014near a former residential school, marking the latest news in what\u2019s expected to be an ongoing series of painful discoveries.\n\nOn July 8, Penelakut Tribe in south-western British Columbia issued a statement on behalf of Chief Joan Brown, council, and elders that says the \u201c160+ undocumented and unmarked graves\u201d were found the the former Kuper Island Indian Industrial School grounds. The Catholic-run school operated from 1890 to the 1970s.\n\nPenelakut\u2019s statement didn\u2019t say whether ground-penetrating radar was used to locate the graves and whether the remains are of children. But it acknowledged the grief and trauma associated with the news and caused by Canada\u2019s residential school system, used to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children, and its ongoing legacy. It also encouraged healing and offered two healing sessions and a march.\n\n\u201cWe are at another point in time where we must face the trauma because of these acts of genocide,\u201d the statement says.\n\nSince May, more than 1,000 unmarked graves have been confirmed at former residential schools, with the first 215 reported by a First Nation in British Columbia. Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation said most of the remains were likely of children, some as young as 3, and the news triggered nationwide mourning, searches for more sites just like it, and unprecedented mainstream attention paid to Canada\u2019s horrific colonial history and its ongoing legacy.\n\nTk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc is releasing more information about its findings on Thursday, including details about the ground-penetrating radar used to search the grounds at the former Catholic-run Kamloops Indian Residential school.\n\nSites in Manitoba and Saskatchewan have also been confirmed, with Cowessess First Nation reporting 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Residential School, also headed by Catholics. It\u2019s the largest unmarked gravesite announced so far.\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate 150,000 Inuit, First Nations, and M\u00e9tis children. More than half were run by Catholics. Sweeping abuses were common, and children were routinely punished for speaking their languages and expressing their cultures. Malnutrition and disease were also widespread.\n\nFormer Kuper Island employee Glenn Doughty alone was convicted of 46 sex-related offences after working at Kuper Island Residential School and elsewhere. But the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated the residential school system and its aftermath, identified fewer than 50 convictions for abuse committed at residential schools between 2007 and 2015\u2014compared to more than 38,000 reports of sexual or severe physical abuse.\n\nNow, people are demanding more, with many calling for Canada and the Catholic Church to face criminal trials for crimes against humanity and genocide.",

            "content": "Last month, Tk\u0313eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation confirmed the undocumented remains of 215 children, some as young as 3, were found buried under a former Catholic-run residential school in Kamloops, B.C. The news reiterated what Indigenous communities have been saying for years: thousands of children died after being taken from their homes by the government, Canada\u2019s federal police, the RCMP, and churches, and forced into residential schools, where they faced sweeping abuses and were often punished for speaking their languages and expressing their identities. An estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children were forced to attend them.\n\nToday, Indigenous children are still vastly overrepresented in the system. In Canada, Indigenous children make up about 8 percent of the population under 15, yet 52.2 percent of all kids in care. The number skyrockets in provinces like Manitoba, where Indigenous children make up 90 percent of all kids with Child Family Services (CFS) , but only about 30 percent of kids total. In B.C., Indigenous children were at one point six times more likely to be seized than non-Indigenous kids.\n\nMary Burton, a Cree woman living in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was taken from her family as a child and said she was kept in the foster care system, away from her family, for too long. She experienced racism throughout, she said. \u201cFor eight years I was put into situations where I was treated less than human,\u201d Burton previously told VICE World News. \u201cI was told I was going to become one of those girls that end up being drunk and pregnant on Main Street.\u201d\n\nMost apprehensions don\u2019t take place because a kid is in danger of neglect or abuse. Burton estimates that 85 percent of Indigenous children in care were taken because they were living in poverty. Right now, nearly half of Indigenous children countrywide live in poverty, a number that jumps to 53 percent on reserve\u2014four times the rate of white children, a 2019 study found.\n\nBurton doesn\u2019t think new legislation matters at this point. \u201cAll you're doing is you\u2019re giving Indigenous communities a small say in how welfare is created and how Indigenous children are going to be ripped away from their families; you\u2019re still going to put them in a stranger home.\u201d The only way to move forward, she said, is to overhaul the system entirely and give First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit communities full control over their children.\n\nExperts have recommended several options to do that, with the TRC\u2019s first five calls to action all related to child welfare. One of them is for Canada to implement Jordan\u2019s Principle, which demands equal access to products, services, and supports\u2014laptops for e-learning, health care, and education, to name a few\u2014for Indigenous children everywhere. It was named after Jordan River Anderson, a child from Norway House Cree Nation, who died at age 5 after suffering from a rare disorder, while the provincial and federal governments fought over who should cover his medical costs.",

            "content": "The remains of 215 children have been found buried on the site of former Kamloops Indian Residential School in Kamloops, B.C. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Snucins\n\nThe remains of 215 children, including some as young as 3, were found buried under a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, a First Nation confirmed Thursday.\n\nTk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc confirmed the preliminary findings with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist who will continue to work with the community as they complete a survey of the former residential school grounds. Ceremonial knowledge keepers oversaw the work to ensure it was done respectfully.\n\nThe 215 children were students of the Catholic-run Kamloops Indian Residential School, which was established in 1890. It was the largest in the Indian Affairs residential school system in Canada, and it closed down in 1978. As many as 500 students would be enrolled at any given time.\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children, amounting to cultural genocide. Findings published by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission five years ago detailed how students were systematically stripped away from their families and communities and forced to attend the schools, where they were often punished for speaking their Indigenous languages or expressing their identities. Sweeping abuses were common and thousands died while attending residential schools. Others disappeared after running away. The last residential school didn\u2019t close until 1996.\n\nCasimir said the community wanted to confirm the burial spots \u201cout of deepest respect and love for those lost children and their families, understanding that Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc is the final resting place.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the community plans to engage with a coroner, reach out to the home communities of the children who were found, safeguard the remains and their burial sites, and further investigate the deaths to see if documentation exists.\n\nSo far, more than 4,100 children who died while attending residential school have been identified as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Missing Children Project, which documents the burial sites of children who died while at residential school.",

            "content": "Leaders of an Indigenous group said on Thursday that they had discovered the remains of as many as 751 people, mainly Indigenous children, at the site of a former school in Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1898, the Marieval Residential School opened its doors and it closed its doors, in 1996. The Roman Catholic Church overseeing the gravesite, the Catholics and the prayer and religion overseeing the grave site, we started our radar-penetrating research on June the 2nd of 2021. As of yesterday, we have hit 751 unmarked graves. Of the 751 hits the machine has a 10 to 15 percent error percentage. So we will only go by the hits that we have of 751. But we do know there\u2019s at least 600. We cannot affirm that they are all children. But there are oral stories that there are adults in this grave site as well. An assault on a First Nation people \u2014 we are proud people. The only crime we ever committed as children was being born Indigenous. A lot of work, a lot of healing will take place. There are many sites that we\u2019re going to be doing this similar work. And we will find more.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn Indigenous group said the remains of as many as 751 people, mainly children, had been found in unmarked graves on the site of a former boarding school in Saskatchewan.\n\nCALGARY, Alberta \u2014 For decades, the Indigenous children were taken from their families, sometimes by force, and housed in crowded, church-run boarding schools, where they were abused and prohibited from speaking their languages. Thousands vanished altogether. Now, a new discovery offers chilling evidence that many of the missing children may have died at these schools: The remains of as many as 751 people, mainly Indigenous children, were found at the site of a former school in the province of Saskatchewan, an Indigenous group said on Thursday. The burial site, the largest one to date, was uncovered only weeks after the remains of 215 children were found in unmarked graves on the grounds of another former church-run school for Indigenous students in British Columbia. The discoveries have jolted a nation grappling with generations of widespread and systematic abuse of Indigenous people, many of whom are survivors of the boarding schools. For decades, they suggested through their oral histories that thousands of children disappeared from the schools, but they were often met with skepticism. The revelations of two unmarked grave sites are another searing reminder of this traumatic period in history.\n\n\u201cThis was a crime against humanity, an assault on a First Nation people,\u201d said Chief Bobby Cameron, of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, the provincial federation of Indigenous groups. \u201cThe only crime we ever committed as children was being born Indigenous,\u201d he said. The burial site also puts new pressure on the current government of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, which even today relies on a set of laws that govern the lives of Indigenous people that date back to the 19th century. Indigenous leaders say they hope the latest revelations will be a catalyst for their long sought-after self-governance. \u201cWe are tired of being told what to do and how to do it,\u201d said Chief Cadmus Delorme, of the Cowessess First Nation. The recent unearthing of remains in Canada has reverberated globally, including in the United States, where this week the interior secretary said the country would search federal boarding schools for possible burial sites of Native American children. Hundreds of thousands of them were forcibly taken from their communities to be culturally assimilated in the schools for more than a century.\n\nBoth schools were part of a system started in the 19th century that took Indigenous children from their families. A National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 2008 to investigate the residential schools, called the practice \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d Many children never returned home, and their families were given only vague explanations of their fates, or none at all. Canada had about 150 residential schools and an estimated 150,000 Indigenous children passed through the schools between their opening, around 1883, and their closing in 1996. The commission estimated that about 4,100 children went missing nationwide from the schools. But an Indigenous former judge who led the commission, Murray Sinclair, said in an email this month that he now believed the number was \u201cwell beyond 10,000.\u201d\n\nChief Delorme also called for Pope Francis to apologize, saying that the Roman Catholic Church needed to address its actions. \u201cThe incredible burden of the past is still with us, and the truth of that past needs to come out, however painful,\u201d Don Bolen, the Archbishop of Regina, wrote in a letter Thursday addressed to the Cowessess group. He apologized and pledged to \u201cdo what we can to turn that apology into meaningful concrete acts.\u201d The discovery in Saskatchewan was made by the Cowessess First Nation at the Marieval Indian Residential School, about 87 miles from the provincial capital, Regina.\n\nChief Delorme said that his Indigenous community, spurred by the discovery at Kamloops and in conjunction with technical teams from Saskatchewan Polytechnic, began combing the area using ground penetrating radar on June 2, hitting as many as 751 unmarked graves. He said he expected more bodies would be found. While it is not clear how the discovery of the remains will be investigated, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Saskatchewan said that next steps, including the potential involvement of the force, would depend on the wishes of the Indigenous group\u2019s leaders. \u201cOur actions must be respectful of the immense grief the people of Cowessess First Nation continue to suffer. We know we have enforced racist and discriminatory legislation and policies,\u201d a police spokesman said in an email.\n\nFor Canada\u2019s 1.7 million Indigenous citizens, who make up about 4.9 percent of the population, the finding of yet another mass burial site is a visceral reminder of centuries of discrimination and abuse, which has led to intergenerational trauma among survivors of residential schools and their families. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying this: All of the stories told by our survivors are true,\u201d Chief Cameron said. Florence Sparvier, 80, an elder of the Cowessess First Nation, said she attended two residential schools, including Marieval, the school where the unmarked remains were found. \u201cThey were very condemning about our people,\u201d she said of the nuns at the schools. \u201cThey told us our people, our parents, our grandparents didn\u2019t have a way to be spiritual because we were all heathens.\u201d Mr. Trudeau on Thursday called the discoveries in Saskatchewan and British Columbia \u201cpart of a larger tragedy,\u201d citing the legacies of \u201csystemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced.\u201d In September 2017, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged the nation\u2019s past \u201chumiliation, neglect and abuse\u201d of Indigenous people, and vowed in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly to improve their lives.\n\nSince the Kamloops announcement, Chief Cameron said, he has been traveling around the province, where farming and mining are major industries, looking at former school sites. \u201cYou can see with your plain eye the indent of the ground where these bodies are to be found,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday night. \u201cThese children are sitting there, waiting to be found.\u201d",

The burial site also puts new pressure on the current government of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, which even today relies on a set of laws that govern the lives of Indigenous people that date back to the 19th century. \n\nBoth schools were part of a system started in the 19th century that took Indigenous children from their families. In September 2017, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged the nation\u2019s past \u201chumiliation, neglect and abuse\u201d of Indigenous people, and vowed in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly to improve their lives.\n\nSince the Kamloops announcement, Chief Cameron said, he has been traveling around the province, where farming and mining are major industries, looking at former school sites. \u201cYou can see with your plain eye the indent of the ground where these bodies are to be found,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday night. \u201cThese children are sitting there, waiting to be found.\u201d",

            "content": "Remains from hundreds of children have been found at a long-since closed Canadian residential school, an indigenous group said Thursday. The school was one of many places where the Canadian government took indigenous children who had been removed from their families for forced assimilation.\n\nThe remains were detected near the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, which opened in 1890, reports the Toronto Star. Although no remains have been excavated, a ground-penetrating radar specialist helped confirm the remains of 215 children by the school.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation responded in a statement Thursday, saying: \u201cGiven the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe age of the children isn\u2019t clear, but Casimir said some were as young as three, reports the Toronto Star.\n\nKamloops, which was operated by the Catholic Church and then by the state in its final years, was one of many residential schools the Canadian government forced indigenous children to attend, reports The Associated Press. The schools took in more than 150,000 kids, and as many as 6,000 of them died, including an estimated thousands from abuse or neglect.\n\n\u201cThe news that remains were found at the former Kamloops residential school breaks my heart \u2013 it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country\u2019s history,\u201d said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a statement. \u201cI am thinking about everyone affected by this distressing news. We are here for you.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian government, in a 2015 Truth and Reconciliation report, determined many of the children who attended these schools were lonely, undernourished, and overworked. \u201cFor the students, education and technical training too often gave way to the drudgery of doing the chores necessary to make the schools self-sustaining. Child neglect was institutionalized, and the lack of supervision created situations where students were prey to sexual and physical abusers,\u201d reads the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report.\n\nThe schooling system, the government determined in the report, was for much of its existence \u201can education system in name only\u201d and amounted to \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d\n\n\u201cStates that engage in cultural genocide set out to destroy the political and social institutions of the targeted group. Land is seized, and populations are forcibly transferred and their movement is restricted. Languages are banned. Spiritual leaders are persecuted, spiritual practices are forbidden, and objects of spiritual value are confiscated and destroyed. And, most significantly to the issue at hand, families are disrupted to prevent the transmission of cultural values and identity from one generation to the next,\u201d reads the preface to the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. \u201cIn its dealing with Aboriginal people, Canada did all these things.\u201d\n\nAfter the Catholic Church ceased operating Kamloops in the 1960s, the Canadian government briefly ran it as a day school until 1978. Gordon\u2019s Indian Residential School, the last of the Canadian residential schools for indigenous children, closed permanently in 1996.\n\nThe process of surveying the grounds by Kamloops is ongoing, and a report will likely be completed in June. Casimir said Friday that more remains may be found as well, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThis article has been revised for clarity.\n\nThe Daily Wire is one of America\u2019s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

The news that remains were found at the former Kamloops residential school breaks my heart \u2013 it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country\u2019s history,\u201d said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a statement.",

Photos by THE CANADIAN PRESS/Rob Drinkwater and THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Lower Similkameen Chief Keith Crow\n\nAbout a week after two Catholic churches burned to the ground on Indigenous land in British Columbia, at least three more churches\u2014not all Catholic\u2014have reportedly been found on fire, while other religious sites have been defaced.\n\nYet another church was found ablaze on Saturday\u2014this time, an old Anglican church. RCMP in northern B.C. responded to reports of a fire in Gitwangak, located between Terrace and New Hazelton, at 1:15 a.m. on June 26. According to Global News, the fire lit up the entranceway of St. Paul\u2019s Anglican Church and the community deemed it intentional.\n\nMeanwhile, parishioners in Edmonton, Alberta, found the statue of Pope John Paul II defaced in front of the northside\u2019s Holy Rosary Catholic Church on Sunday. The monument and the sidewalk surrounding it were covered in blood red hand and foot prints, while several stuffed animals were placed at the statue\u2019s base. Two churches were similarly vandalized in Saskatchewan, with the doors of St. Paul's Co-Cathedral in Saskatoon splattered with the similar red handprints and the quote, \u201cWe were children.\u201d Red and orange paint was poured on the Sisters Legacy statue in Regina.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of anger and grief that people are experiencing right now that they\u2019ve been holding for a long time. It\u2019s not surprising to me that from time to time the anger and the grief takes expression in these kinds of acts,\u201d Father Ken Thorson, the head of Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, told the Saskatoon StarPhoenix. Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate is a Catholic order that ran several residential schools, including two that have recently made the news for having hundreds of unmarked graves on site.\n\nLast month, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation confirmed 215 unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School\u2014painful news that resulted in more Indigenous communities searching former residential schools in their territories. Saskatchewan and Manitoba have already announced unmarked graves, and last week, Cowessess First Nation confirmed that the remains of an estimated 751 Indigenous people are buried at Marieval Indian Residential School. It\u2019s the largest residential school burial site found so far, but more sites like it are expected.\n\nThe news supports what Indigenous folks, residential school survivors, and their families have been saying about the residential school system for decades, and it seems a lot of non-Indigenous folks are starting to learn about Canada\u2019s horrific history and ongoing colonialism\u2014and the Catholic Church\u2019s role in it. Just last week, several lifelong Catholics told VICE World News that they are considering leaving the Church.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d one lifelong Catholic said. \u201cThey have one job to do and that\u2019s to be good people\u2014people that would protect, people that you count on... And, you know, there are pedophiles, rapists and murderers. I can\u2019t stand for that anymore.\u201d\n\nResidential schools were run by the Canadian government and churches to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Sweeping sexual and physical abuses were common and thousands of children died. According to Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, about 4,100 students were killed at residential schools, but that number is likely to climb. Experts think it\u2019s closer to 15,000.\n\nMore than half of residential schools were run by Catholics, who are yet to apologize for their role. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally asked Pope Francis to apologize to First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit communities, but the request was denied. This year, the pope expressed his sorrow, but again did not apologize, despite mounting pressures to do so.",

            "content": "A memorial at Toronto's Queens Park for the 215 Indigenous children found in unmarked graves at a residential school in British Columbia. (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images)\n\nAnother 182 unmarked graves have been confirmed near a former Catholic-run residential school site\u2014the latest in a series of findings that support what Indigenous peoples have been saying for decades, while setting off public outrage across Canada.\n\nLast year, the community of \u0294aq\u0313 am, near Cranbrook, British Columbia, used ground penetrating radar to investigate a site close to the former Catholic-run St. Eugene\u2019s Mission School after finding an unknown and unmarked grave during remedial work at the community\u2019s cemetery, a statement from \u0294aq\u0313 am says.\n\nThe search revealed 182 human remains in unmarked graves, with some of the remains buried in shallow graves only about three to four feet deep. The investigation was conducted at the request of elders to ensure preservation of ancestral remains, \u0294aq\u0313 am said.\n\nWhile the findings are tragic, \u0294aq\u0313 am said it\u2019s too early to confirm whether the remains are of children forced to attend St. Eugene\u2019s. The cemetery in the area was built by settlers in 1865 and many people who died at the nearby, now-defunct St. Eugene hospital were buried there. The community didn\u2019t start burying ancestors at the cemetery until the late 1800s.\n\n\u201cGraves were traditionally marked with wooden crosses and this practice continues to this day in many Indigenous communities across Canada,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWooden crosses can deteriorate over time due to erosion or fire which can result in an unmarked grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of the remains of children victimized in residential schools and buried in unmarked graves is of great concern\u201d \u0294aq\u0313am said, adding that it urges surrounding Nations and the co-owners of the St. Eugene Resort to collaborate during the investigation. (The former residential school building is now a resort.)\n\n\u201cIt is believed that the remains of these 182 souls are from the member Bands of the Ktunaxa nation, neighbouring First Nations communities, and the community of aqam,\u201d the statement says. Lower Kootenay Band is a member of Ktunaxa Nation.\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children, starting in the 1830s. More than half were run by the Catholic Church. Students were systematically stripped away from their families and communities and forced to attend residential schools, where they were often punished for speaking their Indigenous languages or expressing their identities. The last residential school didn\u2019t close until the late 90s.\n\nThe news out of Ktunaxa nation is only the latest confirmation of unmarked graves and many more are expected. On Friday, Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan confirmed an estimated 751 unmarked graves at a former school, while last month Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation confirmed 215, which spearheaded a country-wide search for unmarked graves and lost loved ones. Additional sites in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were also confirmed this month.\n\nAcross Canada, calls are mounting for the country and the Catholic Church to face criminal charges for crimes against humanity and genocide, and many life-long Catholics are considering leaving the church altogether. Various churches have been burned or defaced in the past month. The latest fire was reported on Wednesday, after St. Kateri Tekakwitha Church was found ablaze in Sipekne'katik First Nation. RCMP are treating it as suspicious. Four churches in B.C. and two in Alberta have also been found on fire, and RCMP say they\u2019re considering all of the fires throughout their investigations.",

The community didn\u2019t start burying ancestors at the cemetery until the late 1800s.\n\n\u201cGraves were traditionally marked with wooden crosses and this practice continues to this day in many Indigenous communities across Canada,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWooden crosses can deteriorate over time due to erosion or fire which can result in an unmarked grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of the remains of children victimized in residential schools and buried in unmarked graves is of great concern\u201d \u0294aq\u0313am said, adding that it urges surrounding Nations and the co-owners of the St. Eugene Resort to collaborate during the investigation. On Friday, Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan confirmed an estimated 751 unmarked graves at a former school, while last month Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation confirmed 215, which spearheaded a country-wide search for unmarked graves and lost loved ones.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been 51 years since Deedee Lerat, 60, attended the Marieval Indian Residential School on her home reservation of Cowessess in Saskatchewan, Canada. But the memories of the abuses the Salteaux Cree woman endured there still haunt her. \u201cThere was so much fear,\u201d she says.\n\nThe fear came rushing back when the Cowessess First Nation announced on June 23 that it had discovered 751 unmarked graves at the site of the school. \u201cI would like answers,\u201d says Lerat. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t they reported? Why wasn\u2019t this stopped?\u201d She was five years old when she was forced to attend Marieval. \u201cThat could\u2019ve been me.\u201d\n\nThe discovery at Marieval is the latest in a grim tally of newly revealed burial sites at Canada\u2019s Indian Residential Schools. In late May, the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation near Kamloops, British Columbia, said they\u2019d located the remains of 215 children using ground-penetrating radar at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. In the weeks following, several other First Nations communities made similar discoveries.\n\n\u201cThe news that hundreds of unmarked graves have been found in Cowessess First Nation is absolutely tragic, but not surprising,\u201d Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, wrote in a post on Twitter. More than 150,000 Indigenous children attended Canada\u2019s residential schools, which were created in the 1880s to assimilate Indigenous children into the dominant culture. The result amounted to cultural genocide, as documented by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which issued its final report in 2015.\n\nAlthough the last federally run school closed in 1996, the painful legacy of the schools continues today, with generations of Canada\u2019s First Nations still wrestling with their experiences and those of their elders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to cope so we internalized all that trauma and passed it on,\u201d former Marieval student Marcel Ellery told National Geographic Society Explorer Daniella Zalcman, whose photography project \u201cSigns of Your Identity\u201d explores the effects of this forced assimilation.\n\nAttendance at the state schools, the majority of which were run by the Catholic Church as well as other Christian churches, was compulsory. Children as young as three were removed from their parents by police and taken to residential buildings to live in unsanitary conditions. Most lived there until they were 18.\n\nRampant neglect and abuse were common. \u201cI was so scared all the time. I remember thinking, \u2018don't be noticed,\u2019 because I saw what they did to the kids that were noticed,\u201d said Lerat, who suffered physical, emotional, and verbal abuse at Marieval. \u201cWhoever was killing them thought they were nothing \u2026 just little savages.\u201d\n\nStudents' long hair was cut, and they were disciplined for speaking their mother tongue. \u201cCree is my identity,\u201d Ellery told Zalcman. \u201cHow was I supposed to stop speaking it?\u201d\n\nSome survivors were given numbers in place of their names. Six of the schools conducted nutritional experiments on Indigenous children in the 1940s; some died of starvation. The notorious St. Anne\u2019s residential school in northern Ontario built an electric chair to punish Indigenous students.\n\nSometimes children ran away but very few made it home. Ellery tried to escape 27 times but was always caught. Others died in the extremities of the wilderness, often frozen or drowned.\n\nThe TRC has identified over 4,100 children who died of disease or accident at the schools but admits that the number of undocumented deaths may never be known. After numerous survivors testified to the commission about the disappearance of classmates, being forced to dig graves or witnessing murder and coverups, the TRC petitioned the federal government for funds to investigate the whereabouts of lost children. The request was turned down, and First Nations began funding their own searches for their missing children, which resulted in the recent discoveries.\n\nThe wounds from more than a century of harm are still open. At least four Catholic churches located on reserves in British Colombia\u2019s interior have been burned to the ground in the last few weeks. Several major cities have cancelled planned Canada Day celebrations on July 1 in solidarity with mourning Indigenous communities.\n\n\"The hurt and the trauma that you feel is Canada's responsibility to bear,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent statement. The Canadian government apologized to survivors in 2008 and 28,000 victims have received reparations. In 2015 the federal government hired 17 investigative firms to track down people accused of abuse at the schools and found 5,315 alleged perpetrators.\n\nYet survivors and their families still bear much of the pain of their experiences on their own. Lerat, a mother of six, has struggled with sexual exploitation, homelessness, addictions, and trauma. Over the years she\u2019s attended traditional ceremonies, therapy, church, and healing circles in her quest to recover. But 10 years ago, her oldest son died of a prescription drug overdose, and she relapsed after eight years of being sober. Since then, it\u2019s been a battle to cope. \u201cI still struggle with drugs,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I just gotta learn to walk with the grief and not in the grief.\u201d\n\nThe news of the children\u2019s remains makes it even harder, but she finds solace in the thought that the lost children\u2019s spirits have finally been released.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was crying,\u201d she says. \u201cI told her, \u2018Don\u2019t cry. They\u2019re set free. They\u2019re not stuck there anymore.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "It\u2019s been 51 years since Deedee Lerat, 60, attended the Marieval Indian Residential School on her home reservation of Cowessess in Saskatchewan, Canada. But the memories of the abuses the Salteaux Cree woman endured there still haunt her. \u201cThere was so much fear,\u201d she says.\n\nThe fear came rushing back when the Cowessess First Nation announced on June 23 that it had discovered 751 unmarked graves at the site of the school. \u201cI would like answers,\u201d says Lerat. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t they reported? Why wasn\u2019t this stopped?\u201d She was five years old when she was forced to attend Marieval. \u201cThat could\u2019ve been me.\u201d\n\nThe discovery at Marieval is the latest in a grim tally of newly revealed burial sites at Canada\u2019s Indian Residential Schools. In late May, the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation near Kamloops, British Columbia, said they\u2019d located the remains of 215 children using ground-penetrating radar at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. In the weeks following, several other First Nations communities made similar discoveries.\n\n\u201cThe news that hundreds of unmarked graves have been found in Cowessess First Nation is absolutely tragic, but not surprising,\u201d Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, wrote in a post on Twitter. More than 150,000 Indigenous children attended Canada\u2019s residential schools, which were created in the 1880s to assimilate Indigenous children into the dominant culture. The result amounted to cultural genocide, as documented by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which issued its final report in 2015.\n\nAlthough the last federally run school closed in 1996, the painful legacy of the schools continues today, with generations of Canada\u2019s First Nations still wrestling with their experiences and those of their elders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to cope so we internalized all that trauma and passed it on,\u201d former Marieval student Marcel Ellery told National Geographic Society Explorer Daniella Zalcman, whose photography project \u201cSigns of Your Identity\u201d explores the effects of this forced assimilation.\n\nAttendance at the state schools, the majority of which were run by the Catholic Church as well as other Christian churches, was compulsory. Children as young as three were removed from their parents by police and taken to residential buildings to live in unsanitary conditions. Most lived there until they were 18.\n\nRampant neglect and abuse were common. \u201cI was so scared all the time. I remember thinking, \u2018don't be noticed,\u2019 because I saw what they did to the kids that were noticed,\u201d said Lerat, who suffered physical, emotional, and verbal abuse at Marieval. \u201cWhoever was killing them thought they were nothing \u2026 just little savages.\u201d\n\nStudents' long hair was cut, and they were disciplined for speaking their mother tongue. \u201cCree is my identity,\u201d Ellery told Zalcman. \u201cHow was I supposed to stop speaking it?\u201d\n\nSome survivors were given numbers in place of their names. Six of the schools conducted nutritional experiments on Indigenous children in the 1940s; some died of starvation. The notorious St. Anne\u2019s residential school in northern Ontario built an electric chair to punish Indigenous students.\n\nSometimes children ran away but very few made it home. Ellery tried to escape 27 times but was always caught. Others died in the extremities of the wilderness, often frozen or drowned.\n\nThe TRC has identified over 4,100 children who died of disease or accident at the schools but admits that the number of undocumented deaths may never be known. After numerous survivors testified to the commission about the disappearance of classmates, being forced to dig graves or witnessing murder and coverups, the TRC petitioned the federal government for funds to investigate the whereabouts of lost children. The request was turned down, and First Nations began funding their own searches for their missing children, which resulted in the recent discoveries.\n\nThe wounds from more than a century of harm are still open. At least four Catholic churches located on reserves in British Colombia\u2019s interior have been burned to the ground in the last few weeks. Several major cities have cancelled planned Canada Day celebrations on July 1 in solidarity with mourning Indigenous communities.\n\n\"The hurt and the trauma that you feel is Canada's responsibility to bear,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent statement. The Canadian government apologized to survivors in 2008 and 28,000 victims have received reparations. In 2015 the federal government hired 17 investigative firms to track down people accused of abuse at the schools and found 5,315 alleged perpetrators.\n\nYet survivors and their families still bear much of the pain of their experiences on their own. Lerat, a mother of six, has struggled with sexual exploitation, homelessness, addictions, and trauma. Over the years she\u2019s attended traditional ceremonies, therapy, church, and healing circles in her quest to recover. But 10 years ago, her oldest son died of a prescription drug overdose, and she relapsed after eight years of being sober. Since then, it\u2019s been a battle to cope. \u201cI still struggle with drugs,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I just gotta learn to walk with the grief and not in the grief.\u201d\n\nThe news of the children\u2019s remains makes it even harder, but she finds solace in the thought that the lost children\u2019s spirits have finally been released.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was crying,\u201d she says. \u201cI told her, \u2018Don\u2019t cry. They\u2019re set free. They\u2019re not stuck there anymore.\u2019\u201d",

            "description": "215 bodies discovered at former residential school for Indigenous children in Canada  ABC News",
            "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the recent discovery of more than 200 bodies in the grounds of what was the country's largest Indigenous residential school -- where Indigenous children were sent after being removed from their communities -- as a \"painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter\" of the nation's history.\n\nEarlier this week, Tk'eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc Chief Rosanna Casimir confirmed the remains of 215 children, some of whom were believed to have been as young as 3 years old, in the grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. The remains were discovered using a radar specialist, who has yet to complete a survey of the school's grounds, Casimir said.\n\n\"We had a knowing in our community that we were able to verify. To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,\" Casimir said in a statement.\n\nResidential schools were \"an integral part of a conscious policy of cultural genocide\" against the country's Indigenous population, according to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada report in 2015. The system was created to separate Aboriginal youths from their families and \"indoctrinate children\" into a new culture, the report said, with the system in place for over a century -- the last such school closed in the 1990s. The report detailed many instances of physical abuse and neglect at the institutions.\n\nAt least 150,000 Indigenous children were part of the system while it was active, and more than 6,000 are estimated to have died, according to that 2015 report. There was no recorded cause of death in around half of the cases, and the true number of deaths is unlikely to be ever known due the number of destroyed and incomplete records, according to the report. Enrolment at Kamloops Indian Residential School, which was open from 1890 to 1978, peaked at around 500 at any one time, according to Casimir.\n\n\"It's painful to hear that 215 bodies were found at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School,\" Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, posted on Twitter. \"While it is not new to find graves at former Residential Schools in [Canada], it's always crushing to have that chapter's wounds exposed. Let us not forget them.\"\n\nTrudeau said the discovery \"breaks my heart.\" The Canadian government apologized for the residential schools system in 2008, but Pope Francis has not apologized for the role of the Catholic Church, which operated around two-thirds of the schools, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"The mistreatment of Indigenous children is a tragic and shameful part of Canada's history,\" the lawmaker Carolyn Bennett, who serves as the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, said in a statement. \"Residential schools were part of a colonial policy that removed Indigenous children from their communities. ... We remain committed to supporting survivors, their families and communities through their healing journeys.\"",

            "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally asked Pope Francis to apologize to residential schools survivors in 2017, but the request was denied. Now, those calls are being reiterated. Photos via getty\n\n\u201cAs a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the decision that the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,\u201d Trudeau said Friday, before urging Canadians to apply pressure on their church leaders to release documents that could help identify undocumented children who died while forced to attend residential school.\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Sweeping abuses were common and thousands died while attending residential schools. Others disappeared after running away. The last residential school didn\u2019t close until 1996. More than half were run by the Catholic Church.\n\nMany believe the pope\u2019s comments don\u2019t go far enough, especially since he refused to acknowledge the abuses committed by the Church sooner. The pope\u2019s latest comments come more than five years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its findings and issued 94 calls to action, which hold several institutions to account for their roles in colonialism. In 2017, Trudeau personally asked the pope to issue an apology, but the request was denied.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toronto, Cardinal Thomas Collins, went on CBC\u2019s Rosemary Barton Live on Sunday and responded to criticisms of the Church\u2019s inaction. \u201cI don't know whether seeking always some big, dramatic thing is really the way forward. I think step by step is better,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, the records of the Catholic Church have been made available. If there is any Catholic group that has not made their records available, they should. Obviously, they should,\u201d Collins said.\n\nBut Indigenous leaders are yet to see many records. Casimir said that the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which ran nearly half of Canada's residential schools, hasn\u2019t released any records yet, despite pleas to do so.\n\nEven though Trudeau is applying pressure on Catholics to release records, the federal government has also come under fire in the past for failing to release its own. In 2017, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that residential school records can be destroyed. At the time, the Supreme Court said it\u2019s up to residential school survivors to decide whether their testimonies can be made public.\n\nSome other records in Canada\u2019s possession can\u2019t be released without permission from the Catholic Church. \"Before we have to start taking the Catholic Church to court, I am very hopeful that religious leaders will understand that this is something they need to participate in,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nThe news out of Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc has amplified calls for Canada and the Church to hold themselves accountable. There are growing demands to criminally investigate both organizations, including at the International Criminal Court level, where a group of Canadian lawyers is hoping Canada and the Catholic Church will be tried for crimes against humanity. Indigenous communities are also calling on the Church to formally apologize and release all residential school records. Calls to implement the TRC\u2019s 94 calls to action, of which only eight have been put in place, are also being reiterated\u2014five calls specifically pertain to unmarked burial sites at residential schools.\n\nLocal efforts to reject colonialism have also gathered steam, with civilians and authorities all over removing public statues and tributes honouring residential school architects. At Ryerson University, the journalism school\u2019s publications have already decided to change their names, while the statue of Egerton Ryerson that stood at the university will not be restored or replaced after it was toppled during demonstrations. In Calgary, a grade school that was originally named after Louis Langevin committed to changing its name, and in Prince Edward Island, city council voted unanimously to remove a John A. Macdonald statue.",

            "content": "\"If they wanted extra money, from the money that was given to them, they had to lie sometimes\u2014lie that they were abused sexually and, oop, another $50,000,\" Father Rh\u00e9al Forest said during a July 10 mass, as first reported by CBC News. A recording of the mass was posted on the church\u2019s Facebook page, and CBC News shared the video on its site.\n\nIn another mass, on July 18, Forest talked about the recent spate of church vandalism. He said he saw a nearby church that had graffiti splayed over it with the words \u201cSave the children,\u201d CBC reported.\n\n\"As I'm passing by, thoughts of anger. If I had a shotgun at night and I'd see them, I'd go, 'Boom!' just to scare them and if they don't run away, I'll shoot them,\" Forest said. He then quickly backtracked, saying: \"But this would not help. it's bad to do that; I'd go have a chat with them.\"\n\n\"We very much regret the pain they may have caused to many people, not least of course Indigenous people and, more specifically, survivors of the residential school system,\" Bahuaud said, adding Archbishop Albert LeGatt will determine additional punishment.\n\nThe residential school system was funded by the Canadian government and operated by churches to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Physical and sexual abuses were widespread and are well-documented. The last school only closed its doors in the mid-1990s and the traumatic effects of the residential school system continue to be felt by many.\n\nIn one example, \u201cas early as 1886, Jean L\u2019Heureux, who worked as a translator for Indian Affairs and a recruiter for Roman Catholic schools in Alberta, was accused of sexually abusing boys in his care,\u201d the TRC says. \u201cThe officials responsible for the schools recognized that his actions were not appropriate. Despite this, there is no record of a criminal investigation being carried out at the time.\u201d\n\nResidential schools survivors who suffered abuse were eligible for compensation in Canada as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. The TRC estimates that 48 percent of eligible former students applied for it, but that figure doesn\u2019t account for survivors who died before May 2005. Nearly 40,000 claims of abuse were filed and, by 2014, most of those were recognized, with about $2.7 billion paid out to survivors who were abused.\n\nTk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation recently confirmed 200 unmarked graves at the former Catholic-run Kamloops Indian Residential School site. More than 1,000 additional unmarked graves have been discovered at former residential schools across the country since, and thousands more are expected. These numbers are in addition to the more than 4,100 residential school deaths previously identified by the TRC.\n\nWhile the Anglican, United, and Presbyterian churches have apologized for their roles in residential schools, the Catholic Church has not. Since May, the Church has been in the news several times for a series of missteps related to the residential school system's legacy.\n\nPriests have spread falsehoods about residential schools or downplayed their impacts, while others have remained quiet on the matter. Pope Francis rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s personal request to apologize back in 2017, and this year, he expressed his \u201csorrow\u201d for survivors, but stopped short of saying sorry.",

It was opened and run by the Catholic Church until the federal government took it over in the late 1960s.\n\nIt closed permanently about a decade later and now houses a museum and a community facility with both cultural and memorial events.\n\n\"We recognize the tragic, heartbreaking devastation that the Canadian residential school system has inflicted upon so many, and our thoughts are with all of those who are in mourning today,\" she said.\n\nThe report detailed decades of physical, sexual and emotional abuse suffered by children in government and church run institutions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Carolyn Bennett, Canada's minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, says this revelation speaks to all Canadians about a \"very painful truth\" and a \"horrific chapter in Canadian history.\"\n\n\"This was the reason why five of the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission wanted us to deal with the missing children and the unmarked graves because they knew there was much more than what they had been able to ascertain at the hearings,\" said Bennett.\n\nIn 2019, Trudeau said he and his government accepted the harm inflicted on indigenous peoples in Canada amounted to genocide, saying at the time that the government would move forward to \"end this ongoing tragedy.\"\n\nMcLeod says the residential school system scarred generations in his family and the abuse he suffered at the school in Kamloops terrorized him, his family and his classmates.\n\n\"The abuse that happened to me was physical, yes, was sexual, yes, and in 1966 I was a person that didn't want to live anymore, it changed me,\" said McLeod, comparing the trauma he suffered to that of a prisoner of war.\n\nHe says he entered the school in 1966 along with most of his siblings.\n\n\"Seven of us went at the same time, same school that my mum and my dad went to, there wasn't an option, it was a requirement, it was the law. And I can only imagine what my mom and my dad, how they felt, when they dropped some of us there knowing what they experienced at that school,\" he said.\n\nAs was documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, many of the children in residential schools did not receive adequate medical care with some dying prematurely of diseases like tuberculous.\n\nThe commission estimates that more than 4,000 children died while at residential schools over a period of several decades, but the final commission report acknowledges it was impossible to know the true number.\n\nMcLeod says this week's discovery at his former school has already helped community members he knows discuss the abuse they suffered and the inter-generational trauma it has caused.\n\nHe says he would like to be engaged in healing and now wants to avoid pointing fingers or blame.\n\n\"I have forgiven, I have forgiven my parents, I have forgiven my abusers, I have broken the chain that held me back at that school, I don't want to live there anymore but at the same time make sure that the people who didn't come home are acknowledged and respected and brought home in a good way,\" he said.",

            "description": "Canada Is Mourning 215 Indigenous Children After Their Remains Were Found At A Residential School  BuzzFeed News",
            "content": "The Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0313pemc First Nation confirmed last week that 215 children who attended Kamloops Indian Residential School had been buried there.\n\nCalls are mounting for greater accountability and a search for more unmarked graves after the discovery last week of 215 bodies at a former residential school, one of more than 100 in Canada where Indigenous children were separated from their families. The Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0313pemc First Nation announced the discovery of the children's remains last week, found at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. Some of the children who died at the school, which closed in 1978, were as young as 3. On Monday, Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the find should be a \"catalyst\" for further work uncovering these graves at school sites throughout the country.\n\n \"It\u2019s a prime opportunity to do this very, very important work in all the residential school grounds,\" he told reporters. \"This has to be further researched and investigated. Kamloops is one school. There were over 130 residential schools that were operating across Canada.\" For more than 100 years, thousands of Indigenous children were sent to residential schools across Canada, taken from their parents in an attempt to assimilate them. These schools, many run by religious institutions, operated as recently as 1996 and were rife with abuse. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which was formed to examine the legacy of the schools, has identified at least 4,100 children who died of disease or by accident in these schools. It's estimated that the actual number of deaths could be more than 6,000.\n\n The US government used similar boarding schools, forcing Native American children to live and learn away from their families, and systematically cutting them off from their communities and culture. According to Bellegarde, survivors of the schools, as well as their communities, have told stories about mass graves for decades, \"but nobody believed them because it was too horrific.\"\n\n\n\nIn its 2015 report, the Canadian government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission called the schools an act of \"cultural genocide.\" The report also came up with 94 calls to action for reconciliation, including six in regard to the children who died in residential schools. Recommended actions include creating an online registry of school cemeteries and making sure descendants know where their family members were buried. That work hasn't been completed, and Bellegarde said government funding is necessary to move forward. The Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0313pemc First Nation was only able to examine the Kamloops school grounds now with the help of a local government grant. Hundreds of graves have been found at these sites before, although this latest discovery is particularly large, said Katherine A. Morton, an instructor and researcher in anti-colonial and Indigenous studies at Memorial University of Newfoundland. In addition to unmarked graves at the schools, many sites also purposely included cemeteries, she said. \"If you look at the blueprints for residential schools when they were first built, many blueprints indicated that there were plans for graveyards to be put in,\" she told BuzzFeed News. \"You don\u2019t build a cemetery into a high school for white kids.\" She added that there were indications of mass abuse and deaths at these schools as early as the 1920s, but there was never any formal tracking of the violence while they were operational. The residential schools are scattered across Canada, and some have now been demolished. Some First Nations have made independent attempts to search the sites for remains, but Morton agreed the biggest barrier is funding. In 2009, the Canadian commission requested federal funding to locate the graves of missing children, but that request was denied by the then-Conservative government.\n\nAs Indigenous people mourned after last week's discovery, they also called on Canadians not to turn away from the grim reminder of a system that forcibly took children from their families.\n\n \"We call upon Canada, and all of those who call yourselves Canadians, to witness and recognize the truth of our collective history,\" said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, in a statement. \"This is the reality of the genocide that was, and is, inflicted upon us as Indigenous peoples by the colonial state. Today we honour the lives of those children, and hold prayers that they, and their families, may finally be at peace.\"\n\n Chief Clarence Louie of the Syilx Okanagan Nation in British Columbia said that Indigenous people still feel the impact of the schools today.\n\n \"The level of inhumane and criminal treatment of First Nation's children at the hands of colonial governments and organized religion is deeply disturbing,\" he said in a statement. \"We are calling on the Province of British Columbia and Government of Canada to directly address these atrocities.\" Across Canada, memorials have been created at legislative buildings and other sites, with people leaving pairs of shoes to symbolize each lost child. In Winnipeg, shoes were placed at the Forks, a green space where the Red River and the Assiniboine River join together. Historically, it was an important place for trade and settlement by local First Nations.",

The report also came up with 94 calls to action for reconciliation, including six in regard to the children who died in residential schools.",

            "content": "Canada\u2019s residential school system, designed to \u201ckill the Indian in the child,\u201d as the federal government admitted in a 2008 apology, operated between 1831 and 1996. During that time about 150,000 indigenous children were ripped from their families and forced to attend the schools, punished for speaking their language. Thousands of former students survive today, and many more descendants still bear the scars.\n\nCowesses First Nation made the discovery using ground-penetrating radar, Chief Cadmus Delorme said at a press conference Thursday. The graveyard was established in 1886, he said, when the Roman Catholic church arrived. In the 1970s it became known as the community gravesite after the church and the archdiocese stopped operating the school.\n\nCowesses First Nation began its own ground-penetrating radar search on June 2 after the discovery at Kamloops Residential School in British Columbia. By Wednesday, the radar at Marieval had located 751 hits, Delorme said. With a 10% margin of error, that meant there are at a minimum 600 graves on the site.\n\n\u201cWe cannot affirm that they are all children, but there are oral stories that there are adults in this gravesite as well because it was the Roman Catholic church that oversaw this gravesite,\u201d Delorme said. Anyone from Cowesses First Nation, especially those who attended Marieval, \u201calways knew that there were graves here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a crime against humanity,\u201d said Bobby Cameron, chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan. \u201cThe only crime we ever committed as children was being born indigenous.\u201d\n\nHe said the search would continue, not just at residential school sites but also at hospitals and other institutions that indigenous children might have been brought to.\n\nDelorme emphasized that they were not talking about a mass grave by any means. The graves are separate, marked with 751 small flags, but lacking headstones \u2013 which had at one time been removed by the Catholic Church.",

More than half of all schools were Catholic-run. Sweeping physical and sexual abuses, disease, and malnutrition were rampant, and up to 15,000 children, many undocumented, were killed nationwide. The last school only closed its doors in the mid-1990s.\n\nSurvivors expressed how they felt both criminal and civil justice systems historically favoured residential school leadership and staff. For example, when it emerged that one school disciplined students in 1934 by thrashing their bare backs with straps and feeding others only bread and water for two days, the government conducted an inquiry. The judge \u201ccommended and congratulated\u201d the school for its ability to dole out discipline. \u201cThese Indians, in terms of civilization, are children, having minds just emerging from barbarism,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, the government has paid out $3 billion worth of reparations to 28,000 residential school survivors. There were about 80,000 estimated residential school survivors all over Canada when the TRC published its findings in 2015. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is currently engaging in a court battle, so he can work out new compensation terms for survivors of Canada\u2019s child welfare system, an extension of the residential school system. Experts say reparations need to be pursued, upheld, and paid\u2014possibly in the form of a tax on the Church, too\u2014on top of an apology.\n\nNeither institution has faced criminal charges, and both have failed to hand over many residential school records that would help communities find and identify lost family members, as well as the names of former residential school staff who may have committed abuses. The Catholic order of nuns that ran the Kamloops Indian Residential School is currently refusing to release many records.\n\nAn international criminal tribunal was established to try perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, resulting in 85 convictions, and either long or lifelong jail sentences for many found guilty. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa pursued restorative justice following apartheid. It created a forum for survivors to speak openly and had the goal of cementing the country\u2019s traumatic history as public record, while also creating healing dialogue, so that society could ultimately move on.",

            "content": "Move comes after 215 Indigenous children\u2019s remains found at site of residential school in province of British Columbia.\n\nAfter days of pressure, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ordered flags flown at half-mast on all federal buildings, including the Peace Tower on Parliament in Ottawa, after the remains of 215 Indigenous children were found at a residential school.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday afternoon, Trudeau said the move is \u201cto honour the 215 children whose lives were taken at the former Kamloops residential school and all Indigenous children who never made it home, the survivors, and their families\u201d.\n\nIndigenous community leaders and many others had called on the government to lower flags across Canada after a First Nation in the province of British Columbia (BC) announced this week that the remains of 215 children had been found on the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,\u201d said Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation chief Rosanne Casimir.\n\nThe discovery has spurred \u201ca collective pain and trauma\u201d for Indigenous communities across Canada, while also fuelling calls for concrete government action to address historical and ongoing rights abuses against First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit.\n\nIn 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded the country committed \u201ccultural genocide\u201d with its decades-long residential school system.\n\nBetween the 1870s and 1990s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend the schools, which were run by churches and aimed to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children into white Canadian society.\n\nThe children were separated from their families and barred from speaking Indigenous languages, and many experienced physical, psychological and sexual abuse, among other forms of mistreatment.\n\nFounded in 1890 and run by the Catholic Church, the Kamloops Indian Residential School eventually became the largest school in Canada\u2019s residential school system, counting 500 children at its enrollment peak in the early 1950s.\n\n\u201cThere is so much grief and trauma from the horrific news of the 215 children\u2019s bodies being found,\u201d opposition New Democratic Party parliament member Charlie Angus said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cI am pleased that the Prime Minister has agreed to lower the flags. But this just the beginning. We need answers. We need accountability.\u201d\n\nMore than 4,000 Indigenous children are known to have died at residential schools, but efforts continue to try to find others who never returned home.\n\nThe discovery in Kamloops has raised longstanding questions about the ongoing legacy of colonialism in Canada \u2013 and the intergenerational trauma linked to residential schools that is still being felt in Indigenous communities across the country.\n\nMany observers have also criticised Trudeau\u2019s pledge to launch a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples, pointing to the fact that some residential school survivors are still fighting for justice in court.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s predecessor Stephen Harper formally apologised for the residential school system in 2008. But while the schools may be closed, Indigenous children continue to be taken away from their families in disproportionate numbers across Canada.\n\nAccording to census data, more than 52 percent of children in foster care in 2016 were Indigenous, while Indigenous children made up only 7.7 percent of the country\u2019s total population.\n\nObservers have also pointed to the fact that very few of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s \u201cCalls to Action\u201d have been implemented to date. According to CBC News, only 10 of 94 recommendations had been completed as of April 12 of this year.\n\nThe Yellowhead Institute, a First Nation-led research centre, said in December 2020 that only eight had been implemented. \u201cUltimately, we find that Canada is failing residential school Survivors and their families,\u201d it said.\n\nThe commission had urged the pope \u201cto issue an apology to Survivors, their families, and communities for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s role in the spiritual, cultural, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children in Catholic-run residential schools\u201d.\n\nA majority of the residential schools were run by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nTrudeau also asked for a papal apology, but Pope Francis said in March 2018 that he would not issue one. \u201cObviously I am disappointed in the Catholic Church\u2019s decision not to apologize for their role in residential schools,\u201d the prime minister said at that time.\n\nBefore Trudeau\u2019s announcement on Sunday, several local leaders \u2013 including the mayors of Ottawa and Toronto \u2013 announced they would also lower flags to honour the Indigenous children who died at the Kamloops residential school.\n\nThe town of Merritt, British Columbia, said on Friday that it would keep its flags lowered for 215 hours in memory of the 215 children. \u201cWe must confront reality and acknowledge that atrocities related to residential schools have been committed in the communities we know and love,\u201d Mayor Linda Brown said in a statement.",

The discovery in Kamloops has raised longstanding questions about the ongoing legacy of colonialism in Canada \u2013 and the intergenerational trauma linked to residential schools that is still being felt in Indigenous communities across the country.\n\n But while the schools may be closed, Indigenous children continue to be taken away from their families in disproportionate numbers across Canada. \n\nAccording to census data, more than 52 percent of children in foster care in 2016 were Indigenous, while Indigenous children made up only 7.7 percent of the country\u2019s total population.",

            "content": "Warning: The story below contains details of child abuse\n\nBut the 63-year-old said she had to wait more than 10 hours on Friday to meet with Archbishop Richard Gagnon at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in Winnipeg, in central Canada.\n\nAlong with other residential school survivors, she earlier had affixed 215 orange ribbons to the gate around the Roman Catholic church in honour of the 215 Indigenous children whose remains were found at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia.\n\nShingoose said she was willing to wait all night, though, to make a demand of the Catholic Church: take responsibility for the horrific abuse committed against Indigenous children for decades at church-run residential schools across Canada.\n\n\u201cI told him this is an opportune time for the Catholic Church to admit and to take responsibility and accountability,\u201d Shingoose, who survived nine years at a residential school in the province of Saskatchewan, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeking justice for the 215 children and for the children yet to be found. I\u2019m seeking justice for residential school survivors,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cAs a residential school survivor, we shared our stories over and over again \u2013 and the Catholic Church never acknowledged them or admitted what they did to us in the school.\u201d\n\nShingoose\u2019s meeting just over a week after Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation said it had uncovered the remains of 215 Indigenous children on the grounds of the Kamloops residential school after conducting a ground-penetrating radar search. Some of the children were as young as three.\n\nThe discovery in Canada\u2019s western province has caused pain and renewed trauma for Indigenous people across the country, especially residential school survivors, their families, and their communities.\n\nThe Government of Canada, as well as the Catholic Church, which operated most of the schools, are facing mounting pressure to acknowledge the full extent of the crimes committed at the institutions, to help First Nations uncover other mass burial sites, and to pay reparations.\n\nBetween the 1870s and 1990s, more than 150,000 First Nation, Metis and Inuit children were forcibly separated from their families and forced to attend residential schools, which aimed to assimilate them into Canadian society.\n\nThe institutions were rife with abuse and more than 4,000 children are believed to have died there, mostly from disease, which spread rapidly in the overcrowded and unsafe buildings.\n\nIndigenous community leaders have said there is little doubt that more unmarked graves exist.\n\nUnited Nations experts on Friday also urged Canada and the Catholic Church to conduct \u201cprompt and thorough\u201d investigations into the deaths, including forensic examination of the remains, and work to identify and register the missing children.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should conduct criminal investigations into all suspicious death and allegations of torture and sexual violence against children hosted in residential schools, and prosecute and sanction the perpetrators and concealers who may still be alive,\u201d they also said.\n\nShingoose, a member of the Bear Clan from Tootinaowaziibeeng Treaty Reserve in western Manitoba, attended Muscowequan Residential School in the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan from 1962 to 1971. Muscowequan First Nation identified at least 35 graves at that residential school, CTV News recently reported, and leaders believe more may exist at the site.\n\n\u201cI experienced horrific abuse in the school for nine years: emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually,\u201d said Shingoose, telling Al Jazeera that in addition to an apology from Pope Francis, she wants to see charges laid against abusers and for the Catholic Church to publicly release all its records about residential schools.\n\nGagnon, the Winnipeg Archbishop, who is also president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in a May 31 statement that \u201cnews of the recent discovery [in Kamloops] is shocking\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt rekindles trauma in numerous communities across this land. Honouring the dignity of the lost little ones demands that the truth be brought to light,\u201d he said. The statement did not offer an apology or recognition of the church\u2019s role in abuse at residential schools.\n\nBut Shingoose said her meeting with the archbishop left her feeling like she was not being listened to or taken seriously. \u201cIt almost sounded rehearsed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything. I didn\u2019t get any genuine feeling or any heart(felt) feeling from him.\u201d\n\nFor years, Indigenous people have urged the churches that ran Canada\u2019s residential schools under the overarching auspices of the federal government to acknowledge their role in the systemic abuse that occurred. But while other Christian denominations have apologised over the past decades, the Catholic Church leadership has not.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), which in 2015 concluded that the residential school system amounted to \u201ccultural genocide\u201d, also urged the Pope to issue a public apology on Canadian soil to survivors, their families, and their communities.\n\nIn 2018, after a formal request from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the church said Pope Francis would not meet that demand. Trudeau said at the time he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision but promised to continue pressing for a papal apology. Trudeau reiterated that on Friday, calling on the church again to apologise and release all records related to the schools.\n\nOn Sunday, Pope Francis expressed \u201cpain\u201d at the discovery in Kamloops \u2013 but once again did not offer the long-sought apology.\n\nKathleen Mahoney, a law professor at the University of Calgary, told Al Jazeera that the Canadian government as well as the church should be working with First Nations to uncover other mass burial sites across the country, in addition to turning over their records to facilitate those searches.\n\n\u201cThe churches have impeccable records, we know that. The Catholic Church kept impeccable records \u2013 you can find what they had for lunch back in 1918, if you go through the diaries of the nuns\u2026 The Catholic Church has still not turned over all its records, which is a problem.\u201d\n\nThe Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which ran the Kamloops residential school, told The Canadian Press news agency this week that it was \u201ccommitted to do more\u201d to make its records available. \u201cWe will work to draw the records of daily lives in Oblate communities, known as the Codex Historicus, together and make them available in a more accessible format,\u201d the order said.\n\nTrudeau and several federal government ministers have said in recent days that they remain committed to supporting Indigenous communities in their search for missing children. Ottawa also said its 2019 budget provided $28m ($33.8m Canadian) over three years to address the TRC\u2019s Calls to Action on deaths at the schools. Canada formally apologised for residential schools in 2008.\n\nBut Trudeau\u2019s government also faces mounting calls to take real action to address the legacy of residential schools, including ongoing discrimination against Indigenous children across Canada \u2013 and implement the Calls to Action.\n\nTo date, only eight of 94 recommendations issued by the TRC five years ago \u2013 after a lengthy hearings process during which residential school survivors shared their experiences \u2013 have been completed, according to the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nations-led research centre.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Winnipeg, Shingoose said she will continue to advocate on behalf of other residential school survivors, as well as all the children who never made it home.\n\n\u201cThe little children that are buried in the schools, on the school grounds, they have no voice, so I\u2019m a residential school survivor and I bring that voice for them,\u201d she told Al Jazeera, adding that she also shares her truth for her three children, eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.\n\n\u201cCanada needs to know that truth. They need to know our true history and what happened to us Indigenous children in those residential schools.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s Indian Residential School Survivors and Family Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day at 1-866-925-4419.",

(Andrew Snucins/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nThe former Kamloops Indian Residential School is seen on Tk'emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada on Thursday, May 27, 2021. The remains of 215 children have been found buried on the site of the former residential school in Kamloops. (Andrew Snucins/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nKAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) \u2014 The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation said in a news release that the remains were confirmed last weekend with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\nMore bodies may be found because there are more areas to search on the school grounds, Casimir said Friday.\n\nIn an earlier release, she called the discovery an \u201cunthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\u201d\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nA report more than five years ago by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission said at least 3,200 children had died amid abuse and neglect, and it said it had reports of at least 51 deaths at the Kamloops school alone between 1915 and 1963.\n\n\u201cThis really resurfaces the issue of residential schools and the wounds from this legacy of genocide towards Indigenous people,\u201d Terry Teegee, Assembly of First Nations regional chief for British Colombia, said Friday.\n\nThe remains were detected and not exhumed. Lisa Lapointe, chief coroner in British Columbia, said it was advised by the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc on Thursday about the discovery of a burial site located adjacent to the former Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\n\u201cWe are early in the process of gathering information and will continue to work collaboratively with the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc and others as this sensitive work progresses,\u201d Lapointe said\n\n\u201cWe recognize the tragic, heartbreaking devastation that the Canadian residential school system has inflicted upon so many, and our thoughts are with all of those who are in mourning today.\u201d\n\nThe band is still working with a radar specialist to complete a survey of the ground. They anticipate having a full report ready by mid-June \u2014 one Casimir said will be shared publicly, but not until it has been disclosed to its membership and other local First Nations chiefs.\n\nShe said the band will also be looking into what it can do to repatriate the remains and honor the children and the families impacted.\n\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan said he was \u201chorrified and heartbroken\u201d to learn of the discovery, calling it a tragedy of \u201cunimaginable proportions\u201d that highlights the violence and consequences of the residential school system.\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nCasimir said it\u2019s believed the deaths are undocumented, although a local museum archivist is working with the Royal British Columbia Museum to see if any records of the deaths can be found.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,\u201d Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.\n\nThe leadership of the Tk\u2019emlups community \u201cacknowledges their responsibility to caretake for these lost children,\u201d Casimir said.\n\nAccess to the latest technology allows for a true accounting of the missing children and will hopefully bring some peace and closure to those lives lost, she said in the release.\n\nCasimir said band officials are informing community members and surrounding communities that had children who attended the school.\n\nThe First Nations Health Authority called the discovery of the remains \u201cextremely painful\u201d and said in a website posting that it \u201cwill have a significant impact on the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps community and in the communities served by this residential school.\u201d\n\nThe authority\u2019s CEO, Richard Jock, said the discovery \u201cillustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities,.\u201d\n\nNicole Schabus, a law professor at Thompson Rivers University, said each of her first-year law students at the Kamloops university spends at least one day at the former residential school speaking with survivors about conditions they had endured.\n\nShe said she did not hear survivors talk about an unmarked grave area, \u201cbut they all talk about the kids who didn\u2019t make it.\u201d",

            "content": "A woman hugs her daughter in front of a memorial outside the legislature in Victoria, B.C., honouring the 215 children. Photo by the Canadian Press/Chad Hipolito\n\nThe residential school system was a means of forced assimilation of 150,000 First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples by the Canadian government. More than half the residential schools were run by the Catholic Church, which, to date, has refused to apologize for its role. Abuse, malnutrition, and disease were common in the 139 confirmed residential schools in Canada, and resulted in thousands of children dying.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t pass along Indigenous perspectives to your friends and family and children, though. \u201cThat\u2019s another great thing for people to be doing because then, as Indigenous people we don't have to relive our pain by educating non-Indigenous people,\u201d said Michael Redhead Champagne, a member of Shamattawa First Nation and the co-founder of Fearless R2W, a volunteer-run outreach group in Winnipeg that supports families navigating the system.\n\nCheck in with your Indigenous friends and colleagues\n\nFive of the TRC\u2019s calls urge the government to help communities investigate and document children who died or went missing while attending residential school, but only one has been put into effect: federal support for a national registry of children who died in residential schools. According to the Yellowhead Institute, an Indigenous-led think tank, only eight of 94 TRC\u2019s calls to action have been implemented in total.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure an apology from the Catholic Church would make a difference at this point except for acknowledging the wrongdoing and genocidal acts that did take place,\u201d Angela White, the executive director of Indian Residential School Survivor Society and member of Snuneymuxw First Nation, previously told VICE World News. In fact, many are calling on churches to go beyond expressing \u201csorrow\u201d or apologies for the atrocities committed, and instead start sharing resources with Indigenous communities.\n\nSo does wearing an orange shirt. Orange shirts became a symbol for the many losses residential school students experienced after one survivor, Phyllis Webstad, shared how her orange shirt\u2014decorated with eyelets and lace and given to her by her grandmother\u2014was taken from her on her first day at residential school when she was 6 years old. Officially, September 30\u2014the time of year when Indigenous children were forced to leave their homes and start school\u2014is orange shirt day, but wearing one year-round, especially now, can raise awareness.\n\nThis article contains content about residential schools that may be triggering.

The discovery comes less than a month after officials found the bodies of 215 children buried at another school in British Columbia.\n\nThe hundreds of unmarked graves were discovered at the former Marieval Residential School in Saskatchewan, Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme said in a news conference Thursday. Delorme said a search resulted in 751 \"hits\" but the radar used has a 10 to 15% error rate.\n\n\"We cannot affirm that they are all children,\" he said. \"This is not a mass gravesite. These are unmarked graves.\"\n\nDelorme said the Catholic Church operated the school and its graveyard from 1886 to 1970 and removed headstones at the graves in the 1960s. The news comes less than a month after the discovery of 215 bodies of children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia.\n\nChief Bobby Cameron, of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said the Cowessess people will not stop until all of the bodies of Indigenous children buried on residential school grounds have been found.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday called the pain Canada's indigenous community is the country's \"responsibility to bear\" and vowed to dedicate resources to \"to bring these terrible wrongs to light.\"\n\n\"The findings in Marieval and Kamloops are part of a larger tragedy. They are a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced \u2014 and continue to face \u2014 in this country. And together, we must acknowledge this truth, learn from our past, and walk the shared path of reconciliation, so we can build a better future,\" Trudeau said in a statement.",

            "content": "A First Nation in Canada says it has discovered hundreds of unmarked graves at the site of another former residential school for Indigenous children\n\nREGINA, Saskatchewan -- A First Nation in southern Saskatchewan said Wednesday that it has discovered hundreds of unmarked graves at the site of another former residential school for Indigenous children.\n\nA statement from the Cowessess First Nation and the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous First Nations, which represents Saskatchewan\u2019s First Nations, said that \u201cthe number of unmarked graves will be the most significantly substantial to date in Canada.\u201d\n\nLast month the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were found buried on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school near Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nCowessess Chief Cadmus Delorme and Chief Bobby Cameron of the federation planned to hold a news conference Thursday to provide more details about the new find at the Marieval Indian Residential School, which operated from 1899 to 1997 where Cowessess is now located, about 87 miles east of Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.",

            "content": "Less than a month after Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation found the remains of 215 undocumented children buried under a former residential school, Indigenous communities in Saskatchewan and Manitoba have confirmed other sites like it.\n\nOn Friday, Sioux Valley Dakota Nation near Brandon, Manitoba, said it\u2019s working to identify 104 more children at multiple burial sites at the former Brandon Residential School, which operated from 1895 to 1972.\n\nThe community is working alongside multiple universities, including a research team at Simon Fraser University, to continue the investigation, which started back in 2012. Archival research and new technologies, including ground-penetrating radar, will help the team look for and identify remains going forward, Global News reported.\n\nMuskowekwan First Nation, a community about one and a half hours north of Regina, Saskatchewan, confirmed last week it found the remains of 35 undocumented children at the site of former residential school Muscowequan and Touchwood. Another 35 unmarked graves were found at the former Regina Industrial School, as confirmed by the Regina Indian Industrial School Commemorative Association, an organization that cares for the cemetery at the site, CBC reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really worried about what\u2019s going to be uncovered there. We\u2019re trying to maintain a peaceful mind as we enter into it. You\u2019re talking about children and lost families,\u201d Neil Sasakamoose, executive director of Battlefords Agency Tribal Chiefs Inc., which represents six Indigenous communities in Saskatchewan, told CBC.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of families across this country and in our Treaty territories that have been waiting for their children to come home,\u201d said Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) Chief Bobby Cameron, chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, in a statement. There were about 20 federally run residential schools in Saskatchewan of 139 across the country.\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Students were systematically stripped away from their families and communities and forced to attend the schools, where they were often punished for speaking their Indigenous languages or expressing their identities. Sweeping abuses were common, and an estimated 4,000 to 15,000 children died.\n\nSo far, more than 4,100 children who died while attending residential school have been identified as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Missing Children Project, which documents the burial sites of children who died while at residential school.\n\nIn 2015, the TRC published 94 calls to action along with its findings, including six calls that explicitly reference unmarked graves and undocumented children who were killed at the schools.\n\n\u201cThe most basic of questions about missing children\u2014Who died? Why did they die? Where are they buried?\u2014have never been addressed or comprehensively documented by the Canadian government,\u201d according to the TRC.\n\n\u2018I demand that all governments commit to supporting First Nations seeking thorough investigations into former residential school sites and to take any, and all action available to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions,\u201d Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde said in a statement.",

The were initially run by the government of Canada, then by various churches, and more 150,000 children were taken from their families and placed in the schools between the 1870s and the 1990s.\n\nThe schools claimed to provide necessary education to indigenous children, but they simultaneously aimed to indoctrinate them into Christian and Euro-Canadian ways of life.\n\nFirst Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children were exposed to malnourishment, disease, and sexual and physical abuse, including being beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nAt least 6,000 students are known to have died in the residential school system, though the exact figure is unknown as few accurate records were kept.\n\nThe British Columbia school where the remains were found last month was the largest in Canada, and was controlled by the Catholic Church from 1890 to 1969.\n\nOn Sunday, Pope Francis said: \u201cThese difficult moments represent a strong call to distance ourselves from the colonial model and from today\u2019s ideological colonising and to walk side by side in dialogue, in mutual respect and in recognising rights and cultural values of all the daughters and sons of Canada.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s entrust to the lord the souls of all those children, deceased in the residential schools of Canada. Let us pray for the families and for the indigenous Canadian communities overcome by sorrow.\u201d\n\nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had called on the church to apologise for its role in the residential school system in Canada.\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologised for the harm that was caused by residential schools, and has since offered compensation to survivors.\n\nIn 2017, Mr Trudeau echoed that apology, sincerely apologising for the \u201cdark and shameful chapter\u201d in Canada\u2019s history. He also asked Pope Francis to apologise for the Catholic church\u2019s role in the residential school system, and to make church records publicly available to assist reconciliation efforts in Canada. No such action was taken.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Trudeau but said that Canada was \u201cstill seeing resistance\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the position taken by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Anglican, Presbyterian and United churches have all apologised for their complicity in the residential school system.\n\nEstablished in 2008, the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission aimed to document the history and lasting legacy of the Canadian residential school system on indigenous students, their families and their communities. In 2015, its findings and 94 \u201ccalls to action\u201d to achieve reconciliation were published. One of these calls to action is a papal apology.",

            "content": "More bodies may be found because there are more areas to search on the school grounds, Casimir said Friday.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation said in a news release that the remains were confirmed last weekend with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\nKAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) \u2014 The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nIn an earlier release, she called the discovery an \u201cunthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\u201d\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nA report more than five years ago by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission said at least 3,200 children had died amid abuse and neglect, and it said it had reports of at least 51 deaths at the Kamloops school alone between 1915 and 1963.\n\n\u201cThis really resurfaces the issue of residential schools and the wounds from this legacy of genocide towards Indigenous people,\u201d Terry Teegee, Assembly of First Nations regional chief for British Columbia, said Friday.\n\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan said he was \u201chorrified and heartbroken\u201d to learn of the discovery, calling it a tragedy of \u201cunimaginable proportions\u201d that highlights the violence and consequences of the residential school system.\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nCasimir said it\u2019s believed the deaths are undocumented, although a local museum archivist is working with the Royal British Columbia Museum to see if any records of the deaths can be found.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,\u201d Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.\n\nThe leadership of the Tk\u2019emlups community \u201cacknowledges their responsibility to caretake for these lost children,\u201d Casimir said.\n\nAccess to the latest technology allows for a true accounting of the missing children and will hopefully bring some peace and closure to those lives lost, she said in the release.\n\nCasimir said band officials are informing community members and surrounding communities that had children who attended the school.\n\nThe First Nations Health Authority called the discovery of the remains \u201cextremely painful\u201d and said in a website posting that it \u201cwill have a significant impact on the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps community and in the communities served by this residential school.\u201d\n\nThe authority's CEO, Richard Jock, said the discovery \u201cillustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities,.\u201d\n\nNicole Schabus, a law professor at Thompson Rivers University, said each of her first-year law students at the Kamloops university spends at least one day at the former residential school speaking with survivors about conditions they had endured.\n\nShe said she did not hear survivors talk about an unmarked grave area, \u201cbut they all talk about the kids who didn\u2019t make it.\u201d",

            "content": "The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada's largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\n \n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk'emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation said in a news release that the remains were confirmed last weekend with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\n \n\nMore bodies may be found because there are more areas to search on the school grounds, Casimir said Friday.\n\n \n\nIn an earlier release, she called the discovery an \"unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\"\n\n \n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recall being beaten for speaking their native languages; they also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\n \n\nA report more than five years ago by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission said at least 3,200 children had died amid abuse and neglect, and it said it had reports of at least 51 deaths at the Kamloops school alone between 1915 and 1963.\n\n\"This really resurfaces the issue of residential schools and the wounds from this legacy of genocide towards Indigenous people,\" Terry Teegee, Assembly of First Nations regional chief for British Colombia, said Friday.\n\n\n\nBritish Columbia Premier John Horgan said he was \"horrified and heartbroken\" to learn of the discovery, calling it a tragedy of \"unimaginable proportions\" that highlights the violence and consequences of the residential school system.\n\n \n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\n \n\nCasimir said it's believed the deaths are undocumented, although a local museum archivist is working with the Royal British Columbia Museum to see if any records of the deaths can be found.\n\n \n\n\"Given the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,\" Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.\n\n \n\nThe leadership of the Tk'emlups community \"acknowledges their responsibility to caretake for these lost children,\" Casimir said.\n\n \n\nAccess to the latest technology allows for a true accounting of the missing children and will hopefully bring some peace and closure to those lives lost, she said in the release.\n\n\n\nCasimir said band officials are informing community members and surrounding communities that had children who attended the school.\n\n \n\nThe First Nations Health Authority called the discovery of the remains \"extremely painful\" and said in a website posting that it \"will have a significant impact on the Tk'eml\u00faps community and in the communities served by this residential school.\"\n\n \n\nThe authority's CEO, Richard Jock, said the discovery \"illustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities,.\"\n\n \n\nNicole Schabus, a law professor at Thompson Rivers University, said each of her first-year law students at the Kamloops university spends at least one day at the former residential school speaking with survivors about conditions they had endured.\n\n \n\nShe said she did not hear survivors talk about an unmarked grave area, \"but they all talk about the kids who didn't make it.\"",

            "content": "A First Nations family views the defaced Ryerson University statue of Egerton Ryerson, considered an architect of Canada's residential indigenous school system, following the discovery of the remains of 215 children on the site of British Columbia's former Kamloops Indian Residential School, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada June 2, 2021. REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nTORONTO, June 2 (Reuters) - The discovery of the remains of 215 children at a former residential school in Canada has reopened wounds for survivors of the system, they said, as the government pledged to spend previously promised money to search for more unmarked graves.\n\nThe Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc indigenous nation in British Columbia announced last week it had found the remains of 215 children, some as young as three, buried at the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, once Canada\u2019s largest such school.\n\nBetween 1831 and 1996, Canada's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 children from their homes and subjected them to abuse, rape and malnutrition at schools across the country in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nRun by the government and church groups, the schools' stated aim was to assimilate indigenous children.\n\nSaa Hiil Thut, who spent his teenage years at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, remembers the hunger, the loneliness and the fear.\n\n\"My life became hateful to me,\" the 72-year-old St\u2019at\u2019imc Nation member told Reuters. He was sexually abused by one of the staff, he said, and remembers lying in bed in the silent dormitory, weeping.\n\n\"I couldn't help but think it's monsters that done this, to put bodies in an unmarked grave site.\"\n\nAmid growing outrage, the federal government said on Wednesday it will urgently disburse money promised two years ago to indigenous communities that want to search former school sites for the remains of children.\n\nIn 2019, the government promised C$33.8 million ($28.1 million) over three years to support, among other things, locating the bodies of children who attended the schools. Of that, C$27.1 million has yet to be spent.\n\nElizabeth Prosser, the youngest of 13, was the only one of her siblings not to attend Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nBut the now-55-year-old, a member of the Tsal\u2019alh nation, felt the school\u2019s ripple effects. Two of her older brothers, subjected to verbal, physical and sexual abuse at the school, turned that treatment on her, she said.\n\n\"It just tore us apart. When do we get compensated for stuff like that? ... It destroyed my life.\u201d\n\nMarta Hurtado, spokeswoman for the U.N. Human Rights Office, called the school discovery \"shocking\" and called on the Canadian government to \"redouble efforts to find the whereabouts of missing children, including by searching unmarked graves.\"\n\nShe also called for a legal entity to protect and manage burial sites.\n\nThe Catholic Church ran many of the schools, and the Vatican has not apologized. On Wednesday, Vancouver Archbishop J. Michael Miller said on Twitter \"The Church was unquestionably wrong\" and his archdiocese would be transparent with its archives and records regarding residential schools.\n\nJudy Wilson, Chief of the Neskonlith Indian Band, said her father was five years old, out fishing for trout with his older sister, when the local Indian agent grabbed them, put them in a cattle cart and took them to Kamloops.\n\nHe was separated from his sister, shaved, deloused, and beaten for speaking his own language.\n\nWilson said she wants to see an independent investigation of this burial site and others, possibly involving the United Nations.\n\n\"This is a larger story beyond residential schools. They broke down our family structures, our governance, our nations, our communities. It's a travesty that our children bore the brunt of that genocide,\" she said.\n\n\u201cOur villages were like ghost villages, with no children.\u201d",

            "description": "Jason Kenney Won\u2019t Stop Defending the Architect of Residential Schools  VICE",
            "content": "Last year, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney criticized people in who wanted to get rid of a John A. Macdonald statue in Montreal. Photos by THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson (left) and THE CANADIAN PRESS IMAGES/Graham Hughes (right)\n\nAs people across Canada grieve and contemplate ways to hold colonizers to account after the remains of 215 Indigenous children were found buried under a former residential school, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney again defended the former Canadian prime minister who created the residential school system.\n\nIt started when a reporter asked Kenney on Tuesday whether Calgary, Alberta, schools named after figures like Macdonald should change their names\u2014something one school was quick to do this week. Rather than defer to Indigenous communities, who have been asking for the removal of colonial statues and other tributes for years, Kenney defended Macdonald\u2019s \u201cimperfect\u201d legacy.\n\n\u201cCanada is a great historical achievement. It is an imperfect country but it is still a great country, just as John A. Macdonald was an imperfect man, but was still a great leader,\u201d Kenney said.\n\nAnother statue of Macdonald was taken down and thrown into storage, this time in Prince Edward Island, after Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation confirmed last week it found the remains of 215 undocumented children, some as young as 3, buried under the former Catholic-run Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia.\n\nMacdonald notoriously set up the residential school system, which was used by the government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Sweeping abuses were common at the schools and amounted to genocide. The last school didn\u2019t close until 1996.\n\nDozens more sites like the one discovered by Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc are expected to surface going forward, since an estimated 4,000 to 15,000 children, many undocumented, were killed at residential schools nationwide.\n\n\u201cIndian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools, where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men,\u201d Macdonald said of the schools at the time. The point, he said, was to remove children from their parents, whom he called \u201csavages.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to get into cancelling every figure in our history who took positions on issues at the time that we now judge harshly, and rightly, in historical retrospect...then I think almost the entire founding leadership gets cancelled,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cWithout seeking to cancel our history, we need to know more about it.\u201d\n\nBut efforts to call out other figures are, in fact, ongoing. This week, Ryerson University journalism publications announced they'd change their names, since Egerton Ryerson was \u201cindisputably\u201d a residential school architect. The Calgary school that changed its name was originally named after Hector-Louis Langevin, yet another leader behind residential schools.\n\n\u201cJust when we think we are experiencing acts of reconciliation, the premier contradicts all the efforts toward an understanding,\u201d Watchmaker said in a statement to Global News. \u201cThis country and the province was established at the cost of our lives and well-being.\u201d\n\nKenney has faced steep criticism for failing to uphold Indigenous rights before. Last year, when a Macdonald statue was toppled in Montreal, Kenney said he\u2019d like to see it installed at Alberta\u2019s legislature. Also last year, Kenney refused to fire a speech writer who referred to residential schools as a \u201cbogus genocide story,\u201d and made it illegal for land defenders and protesters, many of whom are Indigenous, to mobilize at pipelines and other resource extraction sites.",

To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,\u201d Rosanne Casimir, the chief of the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc, said in a statement.\n\nCasimir said at this stage, there are \u201cmore questions than answers\u201d as it\u2019s unknown how the kids died, or when, and it\u2019s believed the deaths were never officially recorded.\n\nThe school was open between 1890 and 1978 and ran by the Roman Catholic Church as part of a network of institutions across Canada. They were created to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children by taking them from their homes and forbidding them from speaking their native languages or engaging in cultural practices, the outlet reported.\n\nThe schools were hotbeds for forced labor and physical, emotional and sexual abuse and at least 150,000 kids attended them throughout their existence, the outlet reported.\n\nIn 2015, a historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission probing the residential school\u2019s history described them as a \u201cculture of genocide\u201d targeting Indigenous people in Canada.\n\nFormer attendees of the school told the commission the conditions were brutal \u2014 living spaces were unsanitary, insufficiently heated and \u201cEvery Indian student smelled of hunger,\u201d one former pupil who attended in the 1920s said.\n\nOutbreaks of measles, tuberculosis, influenza and other contagious diseases were rampant at the facility and many kids died as a result.\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told CBC the discovery confirms what the community has known for years \u2014 many kids were sent to the school and never returned.\n\n\u201cThere may be reasons why they wouldn\u2019t record the deaths properly and that they weren\u2019t treated with dignity and respect because that was the whole purpose of the residential school \u2026 to take total control of Indian children, to remove their culture, identity and connection to their family,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nCasimir told CBC that a report will be provided on the discovery next month and the findings are \u201cpreliminary.\u201d",

            "content": "Shoes placed in memorial in front of Parliament in Ottawa, Canada. Photo by The Canadian Press\n\nTk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation issued a statement on Thursday confirming that the undocumented remains of the children, some as young as 3, were found under the former Catholic-run Kamloops Indian Residential School, one of the largest of its kind in Canada. Up to 500 students were enrolled at the school, which ran from 1890 to 1978, at any given time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we reflect on why it takes a scientific study to demonstrate this when communities have been saying it for years. We shouldn\u2019t need that scientific \u2018evidence\u2019 when communities have that evidence in their stories and their families,\u201d said Kisha Supernant, who is M\u00e9tis, a descendant of the Papaschase First Nation, and the director of the Institute of Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology at the University of Alberta.\n\nResidential schools, run by Catholics, Anglicans, and others, were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. It amounted to genocide, something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has acknowledged. Findings published by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) five years ago detailed how students were systematically stripped away from their families and communities and forced to attend residential schools, where they were often punished for speaking their Indigenous languages or expressing their identities.\n\nThe Canadian government flew flags at half mast at all federal buildings on Sunday to honour the 215 children found, but a lot more needs to be done. According to the Yellowhead Institute, an Indigenous-led think tank, only eight of 94 TRC\u2019s calls to action have been implemented. Five of the calls urge the government to help communities investigate and document children who died or went missing while attending residential school, but so far only one has been implemented: federal support for a national registry of children who died in residential schools.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett said $33.8 million was invested in 2019 to support the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation and her team is engaging with Indigenous communities to figure out how to best implement the calls to action.\n\nMeanwhile, the Catholic Church has never apologized to the survivors of residential schools, despite pleas from Trudeau for the Church to do so. (The Anglican, Presbyterian, and United churches apologized in the 90s.) In a brief statement issued Monday, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops said it expressed their \u201cdeepest sorrow for the heartrending loss,\u201d and called the discovery \u201cshocking,\u201d but didn\u2019t acknowledge the Church\u2019s complicity. Neither the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, nor the Holy See Mission, which represents the Vatican at the United Nations, responded to VICE World News requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure an apology from the Catholic Church would make a difference at this point except for acknowledging the wrongdoing and genocidal acts that did take place,\u201d said Angela White, the executive director of Indian Residential School Survivor Society and member of Snuneymuxw First Nation.\n\nThe room for accountability is \u201cendless,\u201d White said, adding that those behind residential schools\u2014governments, churches\u2014need to provide adequate funding and support to Indigenous communities, so that communities and groups like hers can address systemic racism and colonialism, and help their members heal from it.\n\n\u201cEverything that is done around any school has to be driven by the community or communities involved...But they must be resourced to do it, if they\u2019re ready to do it,\u201d Supernant said, adding that exhuming children, IDing them, and investigating causes of death are more difficult than preliminary surveys that locate remains underground.\n\nSimilar unmarked graves at former residential schools are believed to exist since schools didn\u2019t keep clear records, and several First Nations have already committed to leading their own investigations. So far, more than 4,100 children who died while attending residential school have been identified as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Missing Children Project, which documents the burial sites of children who died while at residential school.\n\n\u201cCanada has immense amount of work in the area of reconciliation, and addressing the horrific history that resulted (in) thousands of children not making it home. We will not allow them to cover this horrendous history from the world,\u201d said the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan. The federation has committed to investigate residential school sites in the province and is already in the process of securing the technology that will allow it to do so.",

So far, more than 4,100 children who died while attending residential school have been identified as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Missing Children Project, which documents the burial sites of children who died while at residential school.",

            "content": "Warning: The story below contains details of residential schools that may be upsetting. Canada\u2019s Indian Residential School Survivors and Family Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day at 1-866-925-4419.\n\n\u201cNothing to celebrate.\u201d That is the message from many Indigenous people across Canada, which is marking its national Canada Day holiday on Thursday only weeks after hundreds of Indigenous children\u2019s remains were discovered in unmarked graves.\n\nThe remains were discovered in preliminary searches at the sites of former \u201cresidential schools\u201d \u2013 forced-assimilation institutions at which Indigenous children were subjected to physical and sexual violence, psychological harm, starvation, and other forms of abuse.\n\nIn the days leading up to Canada Day, Indigenous community leaders and advocates have urged people to cancel any celebrations. Instead, they are asking for the day to be one to reflect on the real history of Canada and to support Indigenous people.\n\n\u201cWe need to recognize there is nothing to celebrate about this country right now, especially considering the empty words and inaction of the @JustinTrudeau government. It\u2019s a day where we can mobilize to figure out how we can make this country one that IS worth celebrating,\u201d Indigenous novelist David A Robertson wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Oshkaatisak Council of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents dozens of First Nations across northern Ontario, said it would not acknowledge Canada Day and instead plans to \u201cwear orange and spread awareness about the shameful history of Indian Residential Schools and the devastating legacy that continues today\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a nation of Indigenous Peoples, we must stand strong and shout this out to the rest of Canada. This country\u2019s true history is finally being revealed, and it\u2019s time to stand together and demand justice and accountability,\u201d Oshkaatisak Council member Mallory Solomon, of Constance Lake First Nation, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral Canadian cities have scrapped their Canada Day celebrations in response to the recent discoveries of 215 Indigenous children\u2019s remains at Kamloops Indian Residential School in the province of British Columbia (BC) and as many as 751 unmarked graves at Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan.\n\nChief Jennifer Bone of Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, in the central province of Manitoba, also said in June that the community believes 104 potential graves exist in three cemeteries at the site of the Brandon Residential School, which was open from 1895 to 1972.\n\nCanada\u2019s residential school system operated from the late 1800s until the 1990s. It was part of a wider colonial project that aimed to take over Indigenous lands and forcibly assimilate First Nation, Metis and Inuit children into mainstream Canadian society. Various churches, including most notably the Roman Catholic Church, ran at least 139 residential schools across Canada.\n\nIndigenous people across Canada, particularly residential school survivors and their families, have experienced renewed trauma since the unmarked graves were discovered, while years-long calls for real accountability and justice from Ottawa and the Catholic Church have grown louder.\n\n\u201cAs First Nations mourn and in light of the challenging moment we are in as a Canadian nation following the discovery of the remains of 215 children at a former Residential School, Council has decided to take the time to explore new possibilities, instead of the previously planned virtual Canada Day broadcast,\u201d said Lisa Helps, the mayor of Victoria, BC, on June 11.\n\nDave Ryan, the mayor of Pickering, Ontario, about 40km (25 miles) east of Toronto, said the city would focus on \u201ceducation, reconciliation and reflection\u201d on Canada Day. City flags would also be flown at half-mast from June 30 to July 2, Ryan said in a video shared on social media.\n\n\u201cIt does not feel like the time to celebrate,\u201d the council in Dawson City, Yukon, which also cancelled its Canada Day celebrations, said in a statement, as reported by CBC News.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last week that Canada Day would be a time for Canadians to reflect \u201con reconciliation, on our relationship with Indigenous peoples and how it has evolved and how it needs to continue to evolve rapidly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think this Canada Day, it will be a time of reflection on what we\u2019ve achieved as a country but on what more we have to do,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNot everyone supports the call to cancel Canada Day, however, such as federal Conservative Party leader Erin O\u2019Toole, who said he is \u201cconcerned that injustices in our past or in the present are too often seized upon by a small group of activist voices who use it to attack the very idea of Canada itself\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has served Canada and will soon ask for the trust to lead our country, I can\u2019t stay silent when people want to cancel Canada Day. I am very proud to be Canadian and I know most people are,\u201d O\u2019Toole wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cWe are not a perfect country. No country is. We must acknowledge where we have fallen short. There is a difference between legitimate criticism and always choosing to run Canada down.\u201d\n\nBut Idle No More, an Indigenous-led grassroots movement that is leading Cancel Canada Day protests across the country, said cancelling the events was \u201cthe bare minimum recognition\u201d following the discovery of the unmarked graves.\n\nThe group said at least 50 municipalities have decided to cancel Canada Day events so far this year.\n\n\u201cIt is heartening to see 50 municipalities cancelling Canada Day out of respect for the grief Indigenous peoples are going through. Every other city and town should follow suit,\u201d Idle No More co-founder Sheelah McLean said in a statement on Monday. \u201cStolen Indigenous land and stolen Indigenous lives are not things to celebrate.\u201d",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Communications and Legislative Services-Tracy Dalzell-Heise\n\nAnother two Catholic Churches have been torched in Canada, as more Indigenous Nations have confirmed unmarked graves at residential school sites that likely hold the remains of Indigenous children.\n\nAt 3 a.m. on Wednesday, firefighters were called to a century-old Roman Catholic church just north of Edmonton after it lit up in flames. St. Jean Baptiste Parish in Morinville, Alberta, was basically destroyed in the fire.\n\n\"The fire was already fully involved from the basement when the first fire crews got here. They entered the building but there was already collapse occurring on the inside of the church so they backed out and it's been a defensive or exterior fire fight ever since,\" Morinville\u2019s general manager of infrastructure, Iain Bushell, told CTV News.\n\nA fire was also reported at 4:20 a.m. local time on Wednesday at the Catholic St. Kateri Tekakwitha Church in Sipekne'katik First Nation in Nova Scotia. RCMP are considering all fires across Canada while conducting investigations.\n\nIn less than two weeks, at least seven churches\u2014all but one Catholic\u2014have been found on fire across Canada. Catholic churches across the country have also been defaced, many strewn in blood red hand and foot prints. Some have had stuffed animals placed near the entrance, while one church in Saskatchewan had the words \u201cwe were children\u201d painted across its doors.\n\nThe incidents occur amid new and ongoing reports of more than 1,000 unmarked graves of Indigenous peoples, mostly children, found at former residential school sites across Canada.\n\nLast month, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation confirmed 215 unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School\u2014painful news that resulted in more Indigenous communities searching former residential schools in their territories. Saskatchewan and Manitoba have already announced unmarked graves, and last week, Cowessess First Nation confirmed that the remains of an estimated 751 Indigenous people are buried at Marieval Indian Residential School. Yet another site with 182 unmarked graves was announced this week following an investigation by the community of \u0294aq'am, near Cranbrook, British Columbia, launched last year at the request of elders.\n\nResidential schools were run by the Canadian government and churches to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children, starting in the 1830s. Sweeping sexual and physical abuses were common and thousands of children died. According to Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, about 4,100 students were killed at residential schools, but that number is likely to climb. Experts think it\u2019s closer to 15,000. More than half of residential schools were run by Catholics, who are yet to apologize for their role.\n\nAcross Canada, calls are mounting for the country and the Catholic Church to face criminal charges for crimes against humanity and genocide, and many life-long Catholics are considering leaving the church altogether.",

Some have had stuffed animals placed near the entrance, while one church in Saskatchewan had the words \u201cwe were children\u201d painted across its doors.\n\nThe incidents occur amid new and ongoing reports of more than 1,000 unmarked graves of Indigenous peoples, mostly children, found at former residential school sites across Canada.\n\nLast month, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation confirmed 215 unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School\u2014painful news that resulted in more Indigenous communities searching former residential schools in their territories. \n\nResidential schools were run by the Canadian government and churches to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children, starting in the 1830s. According to Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, about 4,100 students were killed at residential schools, but that number is likely to climb.",

            "content": "Warning: The story below contains details of child abuse\n\nMontreal, Canada \u2013 \u201cThey would just start beating you and lose control and hurl you against the wall, throw you on the floor, kick you, punch you.\u201d\n\nThat is how Geraldine Bob, a survivor of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, described her experience at the facility in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC), where the remains of 215 Indigenous children were recently found in an unmarked grave.\n\nBob\u2019s testimony was shared by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), which in 2015 determined that Canada had committed \u201ccultural genocide\u201d by forcing more than 150,000 Indigenous children to attend residential schools across the country between the 1870s and 1990s.\n\nThe system intended to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society and eliminate what state officials at the time described as an \u201cIndian problem\u201d; children were forcibly separated from their parents and siblings, beaten for speaking their Indigenous languages, and suffered rampant malnutrition, physical violence, forced labour and sexual abuse.\n\nThe discovery of the children\u2019s remains in Canada\u2019s westernmost province on Thursday has reopened persistent wounds for First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit, especially residential school survivors and their families. But Indigenous advocates said it is only the tip of the iceberg \u2013 and across the country, longstanding calls for government action are growing louder.\n\nIndigenous families \u201chad said for years and years that they knew that there were unmarked graves, that they knew that there were all of these children missing\u201d, said Pamela Palmater, a professor and chair of Indigenous governance at Ryerson University in Toronto.\n\n\u201cThis one unmarked grave, of the many that are out there, is exactly what genocide looks like in this country,\u201d Palmater told Al Jazeera. \u201cAnd until we get to the truth, until we bring all of these children home, until we stop engaging in the actions that lead to the deaths of Indigenous peoples, the genocide continues.\u201d\n\nCanada formally apologised for its residential school system in 2008, and as part of a class-action settlement with survivors, more than $2.68bn ($3.23bn Canadian) in compensation has been paid to more than 26,700 claimants, according to a report issued earlier this year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who campaigned on a promise to relaunch Ottawa\u2019s relationship with Indigenous people, said on Friday that the mass grave found at Kamloops residential school was \u201ca painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country\u2019s history\u201d.\n\nTrudeau on Sunday ordered flags lowered to half-staff on federal buildings in honour of the 215 children found, as well as \u201call Indigenous children who never made it home, the survivors, and their families\u201d. A day later, he also said excavating burial sites is an important step in the path to healing and pledged to support survivors and their communities going forward.\n\nBut Eva Jewell, an associate fellow at the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nations-led research centre, said Canada has implemented only eight of 94 Calls to Action issued by the TRC five years ago \u2013 including several related to the more than 4,000 Indigenous children believed to have died at residential schools. \u201cMany, if not most, [of those children] are likely to be buried in unmarked and untended graves,\u201d the commission reported.\n\nThe recommendations included calls for Canada to fund a national deaths register, to work with churches, Indigenous communities and residential school survivors to map cemeteries at the schools, to respond to families\u2019 wishes for commemorations and markers, and to implement a strategy to identify, monitor and protect cemeteries.\n\n\u201cLast year, in 2020, no Calls to Action were completed. If the trend continues \u2026 we won\u2019t actually complete these Calls to Action for another 50 years,\u201d Jewell told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe pace of truth and reconciliation is incredibly slow, which is insulting given that many survivors are now ageing and passing away, and that we have continued and ongoing issues in our communities that are a direct result of these schools \u2013 that ensure that new generations to come are continuing to suffer.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to inequities in healthcare and education, child welfare issues, a lack of clean drinking water, and higher poverty rates, among other things. \u201cThis is all a lived reality for Indigenous peoples,\u201d Jewell said. \u201cCanada is not doing the work it needs to do, they are not putting in the effort they need to do, to actually realise the reconciliation that it purports to want to do.\u201d\n\nSince the bodies were discovered in BC last week, Indigenous leaders also have called on the federal government to provide resources to allow communities to conduct similar searches on other residential school sites across the country.\n\nIn a statement on May 28, Canada\u2019s ministers of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Indigenous Services said the government has engaged with Indigenous communities on how best to implement the TRC\u2019s calls to action related to deaths at residential schools. \u201cWe have listened and are ensuring that the approaches taken moving forward are Indigenous-led, community-based, survivor-centric and culturally sensitive,\u201d the ministers said.\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada told Al Jazeera in an email that the country\u2019s 2019 budget provided $28m ($33.8m Canadian) over three years to support the Calls to Action on deaths at the schools. In 16 virtual engagement sessions, the government heard from survivors and other Indigenous stakeholders \u201con how to move forward on implementing this work\u201d, the department said.\n\nBut observers continue to question the slow pace of implementing the Calls to Action. Others have also pointed to the fact that Canada has spent millions of dollars fighting an effort by survivors of St Anne\u2019s Residential School \u2013 a notorious Ontario facility where Indigenous children were shocked in a makeshift electric chair and forced to eat their own vomit \u2013 to get the government to hand over documents detailing abuse at the school and receive compensation.\n\nWhile residential schools may be closed, \u201cthe government pattern of behaviour towards First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit children has not come very far from the attitude that allowed for residential schools to go in the first place\u201d, said Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada.\n\nIndigenous children continue to be removed from their families and communities in disproportionate numbers. According to 2016 census data, more than 52 percent of children in foster care that year were Indigenous, while Indigenous children made up only 7.7 percent of the country\u2019s total population.\n\nBlackstock also said she is going back to federal court in mid-June as part of a years-long effort to get Canada to adequately fund Indigenous child and family services.\n\nIn a landmark 2016 decision, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled the Canadian government was underfunding services for First Nations children on reserves. The tribunal said discrimination in the provision of services \u201cperpetuate(s) the historical disadvantage and trauma suffered by Aboriginal people, in particular as a result of the Residential Schools system\u201d.\n\nBut while the tribunal ordered Canada to compensate First Nations children \u2013 and later, to extend eligibility for government services to more Indigenous children \u2013 Blackstock told Al Jazeera that Ottawa is still not fully compliant with the decisions.\n\nThe government said earlier this year that it is \u201ccommitted to advancing compensation for First Nations children in care and has undertaken significant reform to the First Nation Child and Family Services system\u201d.\n\nBut with the court battle continuing, Blackstock said it is clear that recent government comments about the discovery at Kamloops residential school are not good enough.\n\n\u201cI think an elder once said that integrity is when words have meaning,\u201d she said, \u201cand what would be far more meaningful and what would be a far more respectful way to honour these children is to stop fighting them in court, to obey the orders and to end the discrimination.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s Indian Residential School Survivors and Family Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day at 1-866-925-4419.",

            "content": "Justin Trudeau has said that Canadians are \u201chorrified and ashamed\u201d by their government\u2019s longtime policy of forcing Indigenous children to attend boarding schools where nearly 1,000 unmarked graves have now been discovered \u2013 but stopped short of launching a national investigation.\n\nAn estimated 751 unmarked graves were recently discovered on the grounds of the former Marieval Indian residential school in Saskatchewan which operated from 1899 to 1997. Last month, 215 remains were reported at a similar school in British Columbia.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian schools \u2013 mostly run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations \u2013 in a campaign to assimilate them into Canadian society.\n\n\u201cThis was an incredibly harmful government policy that was Canada\u2019s reality for many, many decades and Canadians today are horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt was a policy that ripped kids from their homes, from their communities, from their culture and their language and forced assimilation upon them.\u201d\n\nOver the course of 100 years, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society. They were given new names, forcibly converted to Christianity and prohibited from speaking their native languages. Thousands died of disease, neglect and suicide; many were never returned to their families. The last residential school closed in 1996. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which is today the largest Protestant denomination in the country. In 2015, a historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission which concluded that the residential school system amounted to a policy of cultural genocide. Survivor testimony made it clear that sexual, emotional and physical abuse were rife at the schools. And the trauma suffered by students was often passed down to younger generations \u2013 a reality magnified by systematic inequities that persist across the country. Dozens of First Nations do not have access to drinking water, and racism against Indigenous people is rampant within the healthcare system. Indigenous people are overrepresented in federal prisons and Indigenous women are killed at a rate far higher than other groups. The commissioners identified 20 unmarked gravesites at former residential schools, but they also warned that more unidentified gravesites were yet to be found across the country. Thank you for your feedback.\n\nThe federal government has previously admitted that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages. Thousands of children died of disease and neglect.\n\nThe recent discoveries have fanned growing calls across the country for an independent investigation into what happened at the residential schools. Speaking to reporters on Friday, however, Trudeau made no indication his government was considering a national investigation.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government has also come under fire from opposition parties and Indigenous advocates, who have called on him to end litigation against First Nations children who suffered in foster care, and residential school survivors.\n\nThe Liberal government has appealed against a 2019 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that ordered it to pay C$40,000 (US$32,500) to First Nations children taken from their on-reserve homes and communities. The compensation order follows a separate tribunal ruling in 2016, which determined that the federal government failed to provide the same funding to Indigenous children as welfare services elsewhere in the country, a move that amounted to discrimination.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government is also battling survivors of St Anne\u2019s residential school in Fort Albany, Ontario, over compensation.\n\n\u201cShould someone who went to a day school for a few months or a year be compensated to the exact same amount as someone who was in a traumatic situation over many, many years, where they were taken from their families and had a very, very different experience?\u201d said the prime minister.\n\n\u201cRight now, the human rights tribunal says everyone should get exactly the same amount. We don\u2019t know that that\u2019s entirely fair.\u201d",

            "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Pope Francis should come to Canada and apologize on behalf of the Catholic Church for its role in running residential schools for Indigenous children, after hundreds of bodies were located in two unmarked graves.\n\nTrudeau said Friday in Ottawa that he spoke with the pope one day after Cowessess First Nation announced that some 751 unmarked graves at the site of the former Marieval Residential School in Saskatchewan, the Canadian province that borders Montana and North Dakota.\n\n\"I have spoken personally directly with His Holiness Pope Francis to press upon him how important it is not just that he makes an apology but that he makes an apology to Indigenous Canadians on Canadian soil,\" Trudeau told reporters.\n\n\"I know that the Catholic Church leadership is looking and very actively engaged in what next steps can be taken,\" he added.\n\nCowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme said in a news conference last Thursday that the Catholic Church operated the school and its graveyard from 1886 to 1970 and removed headstones at the graves in the 1960s. He said a search of the grounds resulted in 751 \"hits\" but that the radar used has a 10% to 15% error rate.\n\n\"We cannot affirm that they are all children,\" he said. \"This is not a mass gravesite. These are unmarked graves.\"\n\nWeeks earlier, 215 unmarked graves were found at the site of the now-shuttered Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. Trudeau apologized to Indigenous Canadians after the remains were found.\n\nThe residential school system, which operated between 1831 and 1996, removed about 150,000 Indigenous children from their families and brought them to Christian residential schools, mostly Catholic, run on behalf of the federal government, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Vatican has yet to address the latest findings. While he stopped short of an apology, Pope Francis called for reconciliation after the discovery of the 215 graves earlier this month.\n\n\"The sad discovery further raises awareness of the pains and sufferings of the past,\" he said.\n\n\"These difficult moments represent a strong appeal for all of us, to move away from the colonizing model and also from the ideological colonization of today,\" he added.",

            "content": "The decision follows Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation\u2019s discovery of 215 undocumented children, including some as young as 3, buried under a former Catholic-run residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia. There are likely many more sites like it across the country.\n\n\u201cThe history of our country\u2019s genocidal relationship with First Nations has been once again revealed in a way that is painful,\u201d Victoria mayor Lisa Helps wrote in a motion, following consultations with Indigenous leaders. \u201cThe more we reflect, the more we understand that holding the usual Canada Day celebrations could be damaging to the city\u2019s and the community\u2019s reconciliation efforts.\u201d\n\nCanada Day is a national holiday that commemorates the country\u2019s confederation, or birthday. It\u2019s basically our July 4th. But it\u2019s repeatedly been criticized for glossing over the fact that Canada, as a settler-colonial country, exists because it oppressed Indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cKeewaywin First Nation calls on the federal government to carry out exhaustive investigations of all former residential school grounds across the country,\u201d the First Nation\u2019s statement says. \u201cUntil then, Keewaywin will mark Canada Day as a day of mourning.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, July 1 will be used to pay tribute to residential school student and their families and to \u201cacknowledge the role the Canadian government and the churches played in the attempted genocide of Indigenous people.\u201d\n\nResidential schools were used by the Canadian government to forcibly assimilate an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children. Students were systematically stripped away from their families and communities and forced to attend the schools, where they were often punished for speaking their Indigenous languages or expressing their identities. Sweeping abuses were common and thousands died while attending residential schools. The last residential school didn\u2019t close until 1996, but experts say the system didn\u2019t really end\u2014It just became modern day foster care and prison systems, where Indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly the first time people have called on government officials to cancel Canada Day. In 2017, as Canada geared up to celebrate the country\u2019s 150th birthday\u2014the official celebration in Canada\u2019s capital, Ottawa, costing upwards of $500 million\u2014Indigenous folks all over and their allies abstained from celebrating.\n\n\u201cThe fact that half a billion dollars was found to throw the party is no surprise\u2014however it does come as a shock to those communities without drinking water who have been historically told infrastructure is just too damn expensive in remote communities,\u201d writer Ryan McMahon wrote at the time.\n\nIn recent weeks, #CancelCanadaDay has been trending on social media and people are reconsidering ways to honour Canada\u2019s harmful legacy. The hashtag is also in response to recent anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ attacks that took place in Ontario over the weekend.\n\nOn Sunday, a white man drove into a family because they were Muslim, killing four and injuring the youngest, a nine-year-old boy, while on Saturday, a 24-year-old man was attacked by people who made homophobic remarks against him.\n\nWay back when Canada Day was still \u201cDominion Day,\u201d Chinese people referred to it as \u201chumiliation day\u201d and boycotted the event because it landed on the same day that the exclusionary Chinese Immigration Act, which banned most Chinese immigration, passed in 1923.\n\nInstead of Canada Day, Idle No More, an ongoing Indigenous justice movement, has announced several rallies taking place across the country to honour \u201call of the lives lost to the Canadian State\u2014Indigenous lives, Black Lives, Migrant lives, Women and Trans and Two Spirit lives\u2014all of the relatives that we have lost.\u201d",

            "content": "A memorial outside the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, where 215 Indigenous children's bodies were found in a mass grave less than a month ago\n\nAt least 751 unmarked graves were found at a former boarding school for Indigenous children in Canada, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe brutal discovery took place at the site of the Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan, a Catholic school that opened in 1899 and closed in 1997.\n\n\"This was a crime against humanity, an assault on First Nations people... The only crime we ever committed as children was being born Indigenous,\" Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous First Nations said in a press conference.\n\n\n\nLess than a month prior to Thursday's announcement, a mass grave containing the bodies of 215 Indigenous children was found at another such school, the now-defunct Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia.\n\n\n\nBoth institutions were part of a dark chapter in Canadian history, in which Indigenous children were removed from their families and sent to schools run by the government and church in order to strip them of their culture and force them to assimilate. The schools were rife with physical and sexual abuse, and thousands of children died, but the exact numbers and causes of death will likely never be fully known.\n\nCameron said many more of these former schools will be investigated, and they expect many more graves will be found. \"We will find more bodies, and we will not stop until we find all of our children,\" he said.\n\n\"Canada has unearthed the findings of genocide,\" Cameron said. \"We had concentration camps here ... They were called Indian residential schools. Canada will be known as a nation who tried to exterminate the First Nations, and now we have evidence.\"\n\nCowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme said the graves were once marked, but the Roman Catholic Church, which ran the school, is believed to have removed the headstones in the 1960s. Delorme called on the pope to apologize for the church's role in running the residential schools.\n\n\"The pope needs to apologize for what has happened,\" Delorme said. \"An apology is one stage of many in the healing journey.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also called on Pope Francis to apologize for the church's responsibility in the deaths of the Indigenous children. \"As a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position that the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,\" Trudeau said.\n\nDays after Trudeau's comments, the pontiff expressed sadness over the discovery of the mass grave in but did not offer an apology. \"I join with the Canadian bishops and the entire Catholic Church in Canada in expressing my closeness to the Canadian people traumatized by the shocking news,\" Francis said in public remarks.\n\nOn Thursday, Trudeau said he was \"terribly saddened\" that the bodies of even more Indigenous children had been found.\n\n\u201cNo child should have ever been taken away from their families and communities, and robbed of their language, culture, and identity. No child should have spent their precious youth subjected to terrible loneliness and abuse,\" Trudeau said. \"No child should have spent their last moments in a place where they lived in fear, never to see their loved ones again. And no families should have been robbed of the laughter and joy of their children playing, and the pride of watching them grow in their community.\"\n\n\n\nIf you need support, the 24-hour Indian Residential School Survivors Crisis Line can be reached at 1-866-925-4419.",

REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier//File Photo\n\nGENEVA, June 22 (Reuters) - China and its allies called on Tuesday for an investigation into the discovery of the remains of indigenous children in Canada at the site of a former boarding school, prompting an angry response from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe remains of 215 children, some as young as three years old, were found at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia that closed in 1978, the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc Nation said on May 28.\n\n\"We call for a thorough and impartial investigation into all cases where crimes were committed against the indigenous people, especially children, so as to bring those responsible to justice, and offer full remedy to victims,\" Jiang Duan, a senior official at China's mission to the United Nations in Geneva, told the Human Rights Council.\n\nCanada, locked in a trade and diplomatic dispute with Beijing, later delivered a joint statement on behalf of more than 40 countries calling for access to China\u2019s Xinjiang region to look into allegations of the government\u2019s mass detention of Uyghur Muslims.\n\nTrudeau, condemning what he called \"the systemic abuse and human rights violations\" in Xinjiang, said a Canadian truth and reconciliation commission had worked from 2008 to 2015 to address the mistreatment of the indigenous population.\n\n\"Where is China's truth and reconciliation commission? Where is their truth? Where is the openness that Canada has always shown and the responsibility that Canada has taken for the terrible mistakes of the past?\" Trudeau asked.\n\n\"China is not recognising even that there is a problem ... that is why Canadians and people from around the world are speaking up for people like the Uyghurs,\" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nJiang read the statement out on behalf of countries such as Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela, all of which have been criticized by Western nations for human rights violations.\n\nCanada\u2019s residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, constituted \u201ccultural genocide,\u201d the truth and reconciliation commission said in 2015.",

China and its allies called on Tuesday for an investigation into the discovery of the remains of indigenous children in Canada at the site of a former boarding school, prompting an angry response from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \n\nTrudeau, condemning what he called \"the systemic abuse and human rights violations\" in Xinjiang, said a Canadian truth and reconciliation commission had worked from 2008 to 2015 to address the mistreatment of the indigenous population. \n\nJiang read the statement out on behalf of countries such as Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela, all of which have been criticized by Western nations for human rights violations.",

            "content": "Protesters on Sunday toppled a statute of Egerton Ryerson \u2014 a key figure behind Canada\u2019s residential school system, which separated some 150,000 Indigenous children from their homes \u2014 amid growing anger over the Catholic Church\u2019s refusal to issue an apology for its role in the abuse students faced.\n\nThe rally at Ryerson University in Toronto was organized in response to news last month that the remains of 215 Indigenous children had been found in the yard of a former residential school run by the Catholic Church in British Columbia.\n\nSince the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation shared news of the unmarked burial site on May 27, members of the student body and Indigenous communities have renewed calls on the university to change its name and remove Ryerson\u2019s statue.\n\nIn the wake of the statue\u2019s toppling, university President Mohamed Lachemi said in a statement that it would \u201cnot be restored or replaced.\u201d\n\nThe University, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a forum there last week, \u201cis going through a process right now around its own name, and I think what really matters is that these conversations be had in a responsible and mature fashion and that people are really listening.\u201d\n\nPressure has also been mounting on the Catholic Church to issue a formal apology for its role in running schools such as Kamloops Indian Residential School and to hand over all the records that might help to identify unmarked burial sites and the students who died or went missing. The Church has so far refused to do so, despite a request from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a meeting in 2017.\n\n\u201cThat there are still church records that have not been revealed or made available \u2026 is a sad commentary on the lack of the commitment by the Catholic Church to allow us to investigate this further,\u201d Murray Sinclair, a former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, told a parliamentary committee last week.\n\nRosanne Casimir, chief of the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation, told reporters that she wants an apology from the Vatican. \u201cWe do want an apology \u2014 a public apology \u2014 not just for us, but for the world,\u201d she said.\n\nPope Francis on Sunday said during his weekly blessing in St. Peter\u2019s Square that he was pained by news of the remains and called for respect for native peoples\u2019 rights and culture.\n\nBut he conspicuously fell short of issuing a formal apology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pained and saddened. Who isn\u2019t? This is a worldwide travesty,\u201d Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations in Saskatchewan, Bobby Cameron, told Reuters, in response to Francis\u2019 Sunday comments. \u201cHow hard is it for the Pope to say: \u2018I\u2019m very sorry for the way our organization treated the First Nations people, the First Nations students during those times, we are sorry, we pray.'\u201d\n\nTrudeau, who is Catholic, said last week that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the Church\u2019s refusal to apologize.\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest in operation, was set up in 1890 and administered by the Roman Catholic Church until 1969. It closed down in 1978.\n\nA 2015 commission by Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that what happened to Indigenous students at schools like Kamloops constituted \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d They were banned from speaking their own languages and frequently subjected to abuse.\n\nThe report also found that at least 4,100 students died while the schools were in operation, between 1831 and 1996 \u2014 though that number is considered an undercount because many deaths likely went undocumented.\n\nAn apology from the pope is among the 94 calls to action in the report.\n\nChildren housed in the schools often faced abuse, malnutrition, hard labor and rape, and were at risk of death from fire, suicide and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis due to unsanitary living conditions. They died at rates far higher than students in other parts of Canada.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in 2008 for the physical and psychological abuse Indigenous children endured at residential schools. It has since paid billions of dollars in compensations to survivors.\n\nMany advocates say that\u2019s not enough to achieve justice or accountability.\n\n\u201cThe culprits sort of get off scot-free,\u201d Kamloops survivor Saa Hiil Thut, 72, told Reuters, on Sunday after Francis\u2019 remarks.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe pope won\u2019t say, \u2018You know what? I heard there was (thousands of) cases of physical and sexual abuse in those residential schools run by our church.\u2019 He won\u2019t say that. He won\u2019t say \u2018There\u2019s 215 children in an unmarked grave in Kamloops and probably every residential school in Canada.'\u201d",

            "content": "Firefighters' jackets hang on the fence of the burned-out remnants of Sacred Heart Church on the Penticton Indian Reserve, near Penticton, B.C. James Miller/The Canadian Press\n\nTwo century-old Catholic churches built on Indigenous land in British Columbia burned to the ground early Monday morning, about a month after 215 Indigenous children were discovered buried under a former Catholic-run residential school.\n\nPenticton RCMP said in a news release the first fire was spotted by an officer at 1:20 a.m. The officer saw flames licking out of Sacred Heart Church on Penticton Indian Band land and called the fire department. By the time they arrived, the church was fully engulfed.\n\nLess than two hours later, Oliver RCMP was called to a similar fire at St. Gregory\u2019s Church on Osoyoos Indian Band land, about an hour\u2019s drive away.\n\n\u201cShould our investigations deem these fires as arson, the RCMP will be looking at all possible motives and allow the facts and evidence to direct our investigative action,\u201d said RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Jason Bayda in a news release.\n\nThe fires come as the Catholic Church has been put under an international spotlight following the discovery of the unmarked graves of 215 Indigenous children at a residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nResidential schools, which were run by the Canadian government, often through Christian churches, were used to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children and have a long and horrific legacy that includes physical and sexual assault and the deaths of an estimated 15,000 Indigenous children. More than half of residential schools\u2014which were open from the late 1800s until the 1990s\u2014were run by the Catholic Church.\n\nFollowing the disturbing finding in Kamloops, efforts are underway to uncover more unmarked graves. Already, remains of more than 100 children have been confirmed at three other sites in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been criticized, including by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, for its unwillingness to help the effort, with some dioceses holding back documents that could aid in the search for the bodies and understanding of how the children wound up in an unmarked mass grave. The Catholic Church has also yet to apologize for its role in the residential school system.\n\nFather Thomas Kakkaniyil, the priest at St. Gregory, told the Vancouver Sun the church had just held its first service since lockdowns were lifted. He said he believes the fires were arson but committed by outsiders.\n\n\u201cSomebody from outside came and burned it as I understand it,\u201d Kakkaniyil told the Sun. \u201cIt was done on the Osoyoos First Nation land but not by those people. It was somebody else.\u201d",

The officer saw flames licking out of Sacred Heart Church on Penticton Indian Band land and called the fire department. \n\nResidential schools, which were run by the Canadian government, often through Christian churches, were used to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children and have a long and horrific legacy that includes physical and sexual assault and the deaths of an estimated 15,000 Indigenous children. More than half of residential schools\u2014which were open from the late 1800s until the 1990s\u2014were run by the Catholic Church.",

It identified more than 40 \u201csuccessful convictions of former residential school staff members who sexually or physically abused students.\u201d As of January 2015, nearly 38,000 claims arising from physical or sexual abuse had been filed with the government, according to the commission\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cI would strongly encourage [the church] to use this as a teaching moment for them to make sure that anybody \u2014 priests, nuns, staff, whatever it is, whatever their leaders are within their ranks \u2014 are well-informed on residential schools \u2026 and all the other ways that we are seeing the impact of these atrocities within our society,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the discovery of some 215 unmarked graves on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia in May \u2014 and 751 more in Saskatchewan in June \u2014 more than a dozen Catholic and Christian churches have been burned or vandalized. As many as 15 churches have been set on fire, the Wall Street Journal reported, although in most cases police have said there is no evidence they are linked to the unmarked graves.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m passing by, thoughts of anger. If I had a shotgun at night and I\u2019d see them, I\u2019d go, \u2018Boom!\u2019 just to scare them and if they don\u2019t run away, I\u2019ll shoot them,\u201d Forest said of the vandals, according to the CBC.\n\n\u201cI am not just sorry or regret or wish he hadn\u2019t used those words,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish to say very, very clearly, I \u2014 and I hope more and more people \u2014 will come to that place of completely disavowing that kind of thinking.\u201d",

Survivors fear more bodies will be found at the same site - as well as at the 80 other former residential school sites across Canada.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his horror at the discovery. He said: 'The news that remains were found at the former Kamloops residential school breaks my heart - it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country\u2019s history.\n\n'I am thinking about everyone affected by this distressing news. We are here for you.'\n\n'It's a harsh reality and it's our truth, it's our history,' Tk'eml\u00faps te Secwepemc Chief Rosanne Casimir told a media conference Friday.\n\n'And it's something that we've always had to fight to prove. To me, it's always been a horrible, horrible history.'\n\nCasimir said they had begun searching for the remains of missing children at the school grounds in the early 2000s, as they had long suspected official explanations of runaway children were part of a cover-up by the state.\n\nCanada's residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, constituted 'cultural genocide,' a six-year investigation into the now-defunct system found in 2015.\n\nThe system was created by Christian churches and the Canadian government in the 19th century in an attempt to 'assimilate' and convert indigenous youngsters into Canadian society. They were forcibly removed from their families to attend the schools.\n\nMany of the children found dead are feared to have suffered deadly diseases including tuberculosis, although survivors say physical and sexual abuse was rife.\n\nThe National Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada documented horrific physical abuse, rape, malnutrition and other atrocities suffered by many of the 150,000 children who attended the schools, typically run by Christian churches on behalf of state governments from the 1840s to the 1990s.\n\nIt found more than 4,100 children died while attending residential schools.\n\nThe deaths of the 215 children buried in the grounds of what was once Canada's largest residential school are believed to not have been included in that figure and appear to have been undocumented until the discovery shared on Friday.\n\nSurvivors who attended the school say had friends and classmates who disappeared suddenly, and were never spoken of again.\n\nA survivor of the Kamloops school, Chief Harvey McLeod of the Upper Nicola Band, said the gruesome discovery had brought up painful memories of his time there.\n\nMcLeod was taken to the school in 1966 with seven of his siblings, and says he suffered physical and sexual abuse there.\n\nHis parents had also attended the school, and said it must have been traumatizing for them dropping off their children knowing the misery that awaited them.\n\n'I lost my heart, it was so much hurt and pain to finally hear, for the outside world, to finally hear what we assumed was happening there,' McLeod told CNN. \n\n'This is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions,' British Columbia premier John Horgan said in a statement, adding he was 'horrified and heartbroken' that 215 bodies had been found at the site.\n\nChildren would disappear suddenly from the residential facility, and no one would question where they had gone.\n\n'It was assumed that they ran away and were never going to come back. We just never seen them again and nobody ever talked about them,' he told CTV.\n\nChief McLeod said despite the pain and trauma that the discovery had resurfaced, he hoped it would allow he and other survivors to heal.\n\n'I have forgiven, I have forgiven my parents, I have forgiven my abusers, I have broken the chain that held me back at that school, I don't want to live there anymore but at the same time make sure that the people who didn't come home are acknowledged and respected and brought home in a good way,' he told CNN.\n\nAnother survivor Jeanette Jules said the news had 'triggered memories hurt, and pain'.\n\nJules, who now works a a counsellor with Tk'emlups te Secwepemc Indian Band, said she was haunted by memories of the guards coming to the children's rooms at night.\n\n'I would hear clunk, clunk...and it is one of the security guards...then the whimpers,...the whimpers because here is the guy who molests people,' she told CTV.\n\nThe Canadian PM Trudeau wrote in a tweet that the news 'breaks my heart - it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country's history.'\n\nOnce the largest school in Canada, with about 500 pupils at its peak, Kamloops was run by the Catholic Church until 1969, when the federal government took over.\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologized for the system.\n\nThe Tk'eml\u00faps te Secwepemc Nation said it was engaging with the coroner and reaching out to the home communities whose children attended the school. They expect to have preliminary findings by mid-June.\n\nWhether the discovery leads to a class action lawsuit against the church or the State, or even an attempt to bring criminal charges, depends on how the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc decide to proceed, Thompson Rivers University law professor Craig Jones told Castanet Kamloops.\n\nJones said identifying the victims and building a picture of who they were and whether they have surviving relatives could determine any future litigation.\n\n'In the ordinary course, if we were investigating a mass grave in Rwanda or Mexico or the former Yugoslavia, then you would just have a sort of team of forensic experts taking DNA samples without much regard to the gravesite as anything but a source of evidence,' he said.\n\n'Here, we have cultural sensitivities and very delicate protocols that may actually mitigate against finding out all that we can from the remains of the victims.'\n\nJones said he expects the discovery will lead to a fresh wave of lawsuits, but not criminal charges.\n\n'Absent the sort of individual evidence where you could attribute a particular death to a particular act or oversight, you're not going to have a criminal case,' he said.\n\nIn a statement, British Columbia Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief Terry Teegee called finding such grave sites 'urgent work' that 'refreshes the grief and loss for all First Nations in British Columbia.'\n\nThe Tk'emlups te Secwepemc First Nation discovery was the first time a major burial site has been discovered.\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential School, located on the outskirts of Kamloops, 250 miles northeast of Vancouver, was one of a network of dozens of boarding schools set up by the Canadian Government's Department of Indian Affairs in the 19th Century to assimilate the native people into 'European cultural practices'.\n\nOnce there, the students were completely disconnected from their customs and language and forced to speak English or French and indoctrinated with the racist attitudes towards indigenous that were prevalent in Canadian society during the period.\n\nThe Kamloops school was established in 1890 and operated until 1969, its roll peaking at 500 during the 1950s when it was the largest in the country.\n\nFrom 1892, it was run by a Catholic order called the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\n\nAccording to The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, the school's principal in 1910 said it did not receive enough money from the Government to properly feed students.\n\nA portion of the school was destroyed in 1924, and in 1969 the Federal Government took over administration of the school.\n\nThe deaths of more than 6000 children were found to have occurred in the school system, with many thousands more children unaccounted for.\n\nConditions were so rife with disease, abuse and neglect that the odds of dying in Canadian residential schools were about the same as for those serving in Canada's military during World War II.\n\nIn 2017, Justin Trudeau formally asked Pope Francis to apologize for the role of the Catholic Church in the school system.\n\nThe next year, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement saying the Pope would not personally apologize, but that he had not 'shied away from recognizing injustices faced by indigenous peoples around the world'.\n\nThis week, the Catholic church again formally apologized for its role in the tragedy.\n\n'The pain that such news causes reminds us of our ongoing need to bring to light every tragic situation that occurred in residential schools run by the Church,' the Archbishop of the Vancouver Archdiocese, J. Michael Miller, said in a statement.\n\n'The passage of time does not erase the suffering.'\n\nHorgan, the British Columbia premier, said he 'honored' the Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc people as they grappled with this 'burden from a dark chapter of Canadian history'.\n\nHorgan said he was fully committed to 'bringing to light the full truth of this loss'.\n\n'It is a stark example of the violence the Canadian residential school system inflicted upon Indigenous peoples and how the consequences of these atrocities continue to this day.'\n\nCasimir, chief of the Tk'emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation, said she expected more bodies may be found at the site as there were more areas of the school grounds to search.\n\n'Given the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,' she said after the discovery was revealed.\n\nThe First Nations Health Authority CEO Richard Jock said the discovery 'illustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities'.\n\nExperts warned more mass burial sites would be found in the coming years.\n\n'There are residential school burial sites all over Canada, some of which have yet to be discovered,' Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, told CTV News Channel.\n\nAfter hearing reports of the bodies being discovered at the school, Canadian artist Tamara Bell created the display of 215 sets of children's shoes at the Vancouver Art Gallery so people could understand the scale of the tragedy.\n\n'I was so emotional. I was mortified,' she Bell.\n\n'Then this morning I woke up and I realized I really, really wanted to do something I wanted to start healing. I had to do something. I wanted to create a visual so people could see what 215 children look like.'\n\nAn apology 150 years in the making An undated photo of indigenous children with their parents at the Kamloops residential school Passed in 1876, The Indian Act paved the way for the Canadian Government to treat the indigenous populations of Canada without the rights afforded to white settlers. It granted the Government 'exclusive right to create legislation regarding Indians and Indian lands'. Seven years later in 1883, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald authorized the creation of residential schools. 'In order to educate the children properly we must separate them from their families. Some people may say this is hard, but if we want to civilize them we must do that.' The first warning of the abhorrent treatment of the indigenous children came in 1907, when the medical inspector for Indian Affairs P.H. Bryce warned conditions in the schools were a 'national crime'. In 1920, attendance at the residential schools became compulsory for indigenous children between the ages of 7 and 15. Nearly four decades later in 1958, a regional inspector for Indian Affairs recommended the schools be abolished. The Canadian Constitution was amended in 1982 to recognize the rights of 'Indian, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada'. In 1996, a public inquiry was recommended, and class action lawsuits soon followed. Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized to the First Nation peoples in 2008 for the residential school system. The following year Canada formed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which hosted events all across the country for people to share their stories of life inside the residential schools. After seven years of hearings, and testimony from thousands of witnesses, the commission concluded in 2015. It called for a new era of forgiveness and understanding, while recognizing the horrors the system had forced on the indigenous population. 'These measures were part of a coherent policy to eliminate Aboriginal people as distinct peoples and to assimilate them into the Canadian mainstream against their will,' its final report said. 'The Canadian government pursued this policy of cultural genocide because it wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources.'

Michael Miller, said in a statement. \n\nThe First Nations Health Authority CEO Richard Jock said the discovery 'illustrates the damaging and lasting impacts that the residential school system continues to have on First Nations people, their families and communities'.\n\nExperts warned more mass burial sites would be found in the coming years.\n\n'There are residential school burial sites all over Canada, some of which have yet to be discovered,' Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, told CTV News Channel.\n\nAfter hearing reports of the bodies being discovered at the school, Canadian artist Tamara Bell created the display of 215 sets of children's shoes at the Vancouver Art Gallery so people could understand the scale of the tragedy.\n\n'I was so emotional.",

            "content": "Protesters topple a statue of Queen Victoria at the Manitoba Legislature on Canada Day. Screenshots by L\u00facia Rios via Storyful.\n\nVideos posted to social media taken from outside the Manitoba Legislature show a group of people using ropes to pull a large statue of Queen Victoria to the ground while chanting, \u201cTake her down,\u201d and, \u201cNo pride in genocide.\u201d The statue was covered in red paint and a sign that said, \u201cWe were children once. Bring them home,\u201d was placed near it. \n\n\n\nAccording to CBC News, a smaller statue of Queen Elizabeth II was also knocked down.\n\nThe incidents took place amid a wider push to cancel Canada Day celebrations Thursday as the country reckons with the legacy of its colonial roots. In Winnipeg, there were two rallies held to honour the lives of the Indigenous children who died, including the Every Child Matters walk, which ended at the legislature grounds.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on Canada Day here was incredible to witness,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the first time ever we felt powerful on our own lands that we agreed to share with those who wanted to wipe us off the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday afternoon, Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth said a man was arrested in relation to damage to a car and was not tied to the statues. He did not comment on if police tasered the man, which was reported by CBC News. \n\n\n\nSmyth said the majority of the people at the demonstrations were peaceful, but \u201csome of our members were assaulted and spit on.\u201d He said some police cars were also damaged with rocks and paint.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t know if anyone will be charged for knocking over the statues but that police will be investigating using security footage on site.\n\nSince late May, more than 1,100 unmarked graves, mostly belonging to Indigenous children, have been re-discovered on former residential school sites by First Nations. A day before Canada Day, the community of \u0294aq\u0313 am announced it had found 182 unmarked graves near the former Catholic-run St. Eugene\u2019s Mission School, VICE World News previously reported. The findings came after remedial work that began at a cemetery last year; it is not yet clear if the graves belonged to children. Last week, Cowessess First Nation confirmed an estimated 751 unmarked graves at a former residential school in Saskatchewan, following up on the May announcement from Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc First Nation of 215 graves at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nCanada\u2019s residential schools, most of which were run by the Catholic church, ripped an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children from their families and attempted to forcibly assimilate them. Children faced physical and sexual abuse and neglect, and were punished for expressing Indigenous languages and identities. The schools started in the 1880s with the last ones closing in the 1990s.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has identified the names and information about 4,100 kids who died while attending residential schools. TRC chair Justice Murray Sinclair has said the true number of kids who died as a result of attending residential schools could be in the 15,000 to 25,000 range.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for the British government said it condemns \u201cany defacing of statues of the Queen.\u201d The spokesperson said the government\u2019s thoughts \u201care with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the government of Canada with indigenous matters.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, activists have painted various statues of Canada\u2019s First Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, red. Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island council decided to remove a statue of him from its downtown. Protesters also beheaded a statue of Egerton Ryerson at Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University in June. Both men are widely considered architects of Canada\u2019s residential school system.",

            "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is again calling on the Catholic Church to \"step up\" and take responsibility for the residential school system. Photo of Trudeau by the Canadian Press, photo of Pope Francis by Getty Images\n\n(Update, 2:15 p.m.) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who personally asked Pope Francis to apologize to residential school survivors and their families in 2017, is asking the Catholic Church to \u201cstep up\u201d and take responsibility for its role in residential schools after the bodies of 215 undocumented children, some as young as 3, were found buried under a former Catholic-run residential school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really important moment to make it clear that we expect the Church to step up and take responsibility for its role in this and be there to help in the grieving and the healing, including with records, as necessary,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing resistance from the Church, possibly from the Church in Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should conduct criminal investigations into all suspicious death and allegations of torture and sexual violence against children hosted in residential schools, and prosecute and sanction the perpetrators and concealors who may still be alive,\u201d says a statement issued by the UN\u2019s Human rights Special Procedures office, which is staffed by independent, volunteer experts who advise on human rights issues.\n\nLast week, Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation announced it found the children under the former Kamloops Indian Residential School using ground-radar technology. The findings reiterated what Indigenous communities have been saying for years: there are unmarked graves at residential schools across the country. An estimated 4,000 to 15,000 children, many undocumented, were killed at residential schools nationwide.\n\n\u201cLarge-scale human rights violations have been committed against children belonging to Indigenous communities,\u201d the UN statement says. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Canada and the Holy See would leave such heinous crimes unaccounted for and without full redress.\u201d\n\nThe experts are also urging Canada to implement the Truth and Reconciliation calls to action, first published in 2015. So far, only eight of 94 have been implemented\u2014and just one related to unmarked burials of children killed at residential schools. \u201cFor too many years, victims and their families have been waiting for justice and remedy. Accountability, comprehensive truth, and full reparation must be urgently pursued,\u201d it says.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a group of 15 lawyers has asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Canada and the Vatican for crimes against humanity.\n\n\u201cThe complainants submit the deaths, mass unmarked grave, and general treatment of the 215 deceased children constitute crimes against humanity. The complainants also submit it is likely other such mass graves exist elsewhere in Canada in or around other residential schools and have been covered up by the government of Canada and/or Vatican, their agents, employees, or actors,\u201d says the letter. It\u2019s addressed to Karim Khan, chief prosecutor at the ICC.\n\nThe letter asks for an investigation into the circumstances of deaths and mass burials of the 215 children. \u201cThe aboriginal people of Canada, and all people of Canada, need assurance that the agents, employees, and actors of the government of Canada and the Vatican behind these crimes against humanity are subject to justice,\u201d it says.\n\nICC can step in and investigate when countries refuse or are unable to do so themselves, and it can compel all those involved to submit relevant documents and information. The body steps in when at least one of four crimes\u2014genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression\u2014is suspected. Crimes against humanity, or \u201cserious violations committed as part of a large-scale attack against any civilian population,\u201d the ICC site says, can include murder, rape, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, and enslavement, especially committed against women and children.",

The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada's largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked Sunday that flags at all federal buildings be flown at half-staff to honor more than 200 children whose remains have been found buried at what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nThe Peace Tower flag on Parliament Hill in the nation\u2019s capital of Ottawa was among those lowered to half-staff.\n\n\u201cTo honor the 215 children whose lives were taken at the former Kamloops residential school and all Indigenous children who never made it home, the survivors, and their families, I have asked that the Peace Tower and all federal buildings be flown at half-mast,\u201d Trudeau tweeted.\n\nMayors of communities across Ontario, including Toronto, Ottawa, Mississauga and Brampton, also ordered flags lowered to honor the children.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were confirmed last weekend with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\nShe described the discovery as \u201can unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\u2033\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nPlans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the site.\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nThe National Truth and Reconciliation Commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963.\n\nPerry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said while it is not new to find graves at former residential schools, it\u2019s always crushing to have that chapter\u2019s wounds exposed.\n\nThe chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, R. Stacey LaForme, wrote Trudeau on Saturday to ask the government to lower the flags and declare a national day of mourning.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done but first and foremost, we need to do this to show love and respect to the 215 children, all of the children, and their families,\u201d LaForme said in a statement. \u201cThis should be a moment that the country never forgets.\u201d\n\nSol Mamakwa, an Indigenous opposition legislator who represents the Ontario riding of Kiiwetinoong, called on the province and Canadian government to work with all First Nations to look for remains at other defunct residential schools.\n\n\u201cIt is a great open secret that our children lie on the properties of the former schools \u2014 an open secret that Canadians can no longer look away from,\u201d Mamakwa said. \u201cIn keeping with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Missing Children Projects, every school site must be searched for the graves of our ancestors.\u201d\n\nToronto Mayor John Tory said city flags would stay lowered for nine days \u2014 215 hours \u2014 to represent each life.\n\n\u201cThis sad story is shocking but not surprising to students of history, I don\u2019t think we know yet when these deaths occurred,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.\n\n\u201cCanada of yesteryear is not the Canada of today,\u2033 he said.",

            "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it\u2019s not an isolated incident that over 200 children were found buried at a former Indigenous residential school\n\nTORONTO -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday it \u2019s not an isolated incident that over 200 children were found buried at a former Indigenous residential school.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s comments come as Indigenous leaders are calling for an examination of every former residential school site \u2014 institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were confirmed this month with the help of ground-penetrating radar. She described the discovery as \u201can unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented\u201d at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest such school in the country.\n\n\u201cAs prime minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole Indigenous children from their communities,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not an exception or an isolated incident,'' he said. \u2018\u2019We\u2019re not going to hide from that. We have to acknowledge the truth. Residential schools were a reality \u2014 a tragedy that existed here, in our country, and we have to own up to it. Kids were taken from their families, returned damaged or not returned at all.\"\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nPlans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the Kamloops site.\n\nTrudeau said he\u2019ll be talking to his ministers about further things his government needs to do to support survivors and the community. Flags at all federal buildings are at half-staff.\n\nOpposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh called Monday afor an emergency debate in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise. This is a reality of residential schools,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201c215 Indigenous kids were found in an unmarked mass grave,'' he said. \u2018\u2019Anytime we think about unmarked mass graves, we think about a distant country where a genocide has happened. This is not a distant country.\u201d\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nRichard Gagnon, archbishop of Winnipeg and president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, said he wanted to express \u201cour deepest sorrow for the heartrending loss of the children at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School.\u201d\n\nThe National Truth and Reconciliation Commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963. The Commission identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Some died of tuberculosis. The Commission said the practice was not to send the bodies of the students who died at the schools to their communities. The Commission also said the government wanted to keep costs down so adequate regulations were never established.\n\n\u201cThis discovery is a stain on our country. It is one that needs to be rectified,\u201d Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner said.\n\nEmpty pairs of children\u2019s shoes have been placed at memorials throughout the country.\n\nPerry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, has said while it is not new to find graves at former residential schools, it\u2019s always crushing to have that chapter\u2019s wounds exposed.\n\nThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations and the Saskatchewan government said they want Ottawa to help research undocumented deaths and burials at residential schools in the province.\n\nFederation Chief Bobby Cameron said finding the children\u2019s remains and giving them proper burials is important to help First Nations communities and families find closure. The federation has compiled a list of initial sites where it hopes to complete radar ground searches.\n\nSol Mamakwa, an opposition lawmaker with the New Democrat party in Ontario, also called on the government to search the grounds of other former residential schools.\n\n\u201cIt is a great open secret that our children lie on the properties of former schools. It is an open secret that Canadians can no longer look away from,\u201d he said.",

            "title": "Trudeau: 'Canadians are horrified and ashamed'",
            "description": "Trudeau: 'Canadians are horrified and ashamed'  POLITICO",
            "content": "\u201cThis is a piece of our past that resonates and echoes and continues to be a lived reality of consequences for many, many Canadians today,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nThe prime minister wouldn't commit to an independent inquiry with the power to investigate potential criminal action \u2014 though he didn't rule it out. \u201cWe will keep putting Indigenous peoples and their wishes at the center of everything we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are there to be a partner in whatever is needed to find the full truth and ensure reconciliation is possible.\u201d\n\nFor a prime minister who has promised Indigenous people in Canada \u201ca new relationship\u201d on the road to reconciliation, the latest headlines underline the tension between Trudeau's lofty ambition and his country's ugly, violent history.\n\nSoaring rhetoric has never been Trudeau's weakness. But after six years of Liberal government, Indigenous people are still overrepresented in Canada's prisons. The Liberals have ended 108 long-term drinking water advisories, but 51 remain in 32 communities that still don't have clean drinking water.\n\nBobby Cameron, the chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said Thursday that the 751 flags marking buried bodies at the former Marieval Indian Residential School are proof of a \u201ccrime against humanity.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Bob Rae, told POLITICO that Canadians must confront the disturbing truth that is unfolding in front of their eyes.\n\n\u201cWe all have to come to grips with what a crime against humanity means, what its historic consequences were, and what other forms of accountability flow from that,\u201d Rae said Thursday after the news came to light.\n\nTwo weeks ago, more than 200 graves were identified at another former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia. There are certain to be more revelations. The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement pegged the number of church-run, federally funded institutions in Canada at 139. They first opened in the 1870s, and the last school closed in 1997. More than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend them, and more than 6,000 are estimated to have died as a result of disease, malnourishment and suicide, among other causes. The children often faced physical and sexual abuse.\n\nIn 2008, then-prime minister Stephen Harper formally apologized for the government's role in residential schools. Harper's government launched the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by a justice named Murray Sinclair, to fully document the history of the system and hear from survivors.\n\nMuch of what Canadians are now learning was published six years ago in the TRC's multivolume final report \u2014 including details about the residential school at Marieval.\n\nOn Thursday, Cowessess First Nation chief Cadmus Delorme said local oral histories had passed down stories of children buried in unmarked graves. The ground-penetrating radar now being used to locate the bodies only confirms what they knew to be true.\n\nWhen the Trudeau government came to power, the prime minister promised to implement every call to action in the TRC's report. The government has pledged progress on most of them, but critics say the Liberals are nowhere close to completing the work.\n\nThe recent discoveries have made global headlines, and a Chinese government constantly at odds with Canada took notice. On Tuesday, only hours after Canada led a multilateral statement at the U.N. Human Rights Council that was heavily critical of China\u2019s treatment of minority groups including Uyghurs in Xinjiang province, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson flipped the script.\n\nHua Chunying tweeted an infographic that shamed Canada\u2019s record on residential schools and disproportionately poor education and employment outcomes for Indigenous people.\n\nTrudeau insisted, in response, that Canada is owning up to its past.\n\n\u201cWhere is China\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission? Where is their truth?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is the openness that Canada has always shown and the responsibility that Canada has taken for the terrible mistakes of the past and, indeed, many of which continue into the present?\"\n\nThe revelations have also made waves in Washington. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said earlier this week that she was \u201cdeeply impacted\u201d by the discovery of unmarked graves in Canada. She announced the U.S. federal government will launch a review of American boarding schools that, like Canada\u2019s residential school system, attempted to force cultural assimilation onto Native Americans.\n\nRae says his message to concerned diplomats around the world will exude transparency. \"We have to share with them that we have nothing to hide, there\u2019s nothing to be concealed,\" he said. \"There\u2019s much to be ashamed of. I don\u2019t think we can expect to avoid international scrutiny. We will face it.\"\n\nCanadians were already facing uncomfortable questions about how to celebrate Canada Day, a national holiday on July 1 that marks the country's founding in 1867. Canada's first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, played a key role in authorizing the establishment of residential schools.\n\nStatues built in Macdonald's likeness are now coming under increased scrutiny \u2014 and, in some cases, being removed from prominent positions in town squares. Activists also recently tore down a statue of Egerton Ryerson, the namesake of a university in Toronto who helped design the residential school system.\n\nNow, a growing number of communities are pausing Canada Day celebrations, including two provincial capitals on opposite sides of the country: Victoria, British Columbia, and Fredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nOn Friday, Trudeau encouraged Canadians to reflect on their history. \"I think we all need to pledge ourselves to doing what we can to continue that effort to make Canada better, all the while respecting, and listening to those for whom it's not yet a day of celebration,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, the Liberal budget pledged C$33.8 million over three years for a residential school death register and another online registry of cemeteries at school sites \u2014 part of an effort to implement specific calls to action from the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nOn Thursday, Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller pledged more money, calling the Kamloops and Saskatchewan discoveries the \"tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nAs Canadians learned about the unmarked graves in Saskatchewan, a former Liberal Cabinet minister who now sits as an independent member of Parliament dropped a bombshell. Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was the first Indigenous justice minister, tweeted a screenshot of a text message from Carolyn Bennett, the current minister for Crown-Indigenous Relations.\n\nBennett's message included a link to a tweet in which Wilson-Raybould called on the prime minister to focus on helping Indigenous kids instead of \"jockeying\" for an election. Bennett had texted the tweet back to her former colleague with a one-word annotation \u2014 \"Pension?\" \u2014 a reference to the fact that Wilson-Raybould will only qualify for a generous parliamentary pension in October.\n\nThat pension only kicks in after six years on the job. A trip to the polls earlier than mid-October would threaten the jobs of dozens of MPs who were first elected in 2015, the same year Wilson-Raybould won her Vancouver seat.\n\nWilson-Raybould called the text racist and misogynist, and accused Bennett of implying she's only concerned with padding her post-parliamentary income. Bennett quickly apologized, expressing deep regret and blaming \"interpersonal dynamics.\"\n\nThe Union of BC Indian Chiefs was one of the most prominent voices to demand the minister's resignation. Trudeau said he was \"deeply disappointed\" in Bennett's tweet, which he called \"wrong\" and \"hurtful.\" But as of Friday, Bennett appeared to face no public consequences for her tweet.\n\nAnyone experiencing distress or pain can call the Indian Residential School Survivors Society Crisis Line, open 24 hours a day: 1-866-925-4419.",

            "content": "A statue of Canadian educator Egerton Ryerson, located at Ryerson University in Toronto, was toppled this weekend and beheaded by extremists who threw the monument in Toronto harbour.\n\nThe toppling of the statue came amid protests in the city over what are believed to be 215 unmarked children\u2019s graves found on the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwepemc First Nations reserve in Kamloops, British Columbia. The discovery has been claimed as a mass grave in some media reports, such as the BBC, despite a press conference last week clarifying they are believed to be a series of individual graves.\n\nThe statue was pulled down in the late afternoon on Sunday after years of controversy over Ryerson\u2019s role in the implementation of the residential school system in Canada.\n\nAccording to a report from CTV, in 2010 Ryerson university stated that Ryerson himself had not personally implemented or overseen any residential schools, but years later the university acknowledged Ryerson had influenced the residential school system.\n\nThe reported graves in Kamloops were located by a major residential school that had opened several years after Ryerson\u2019s death.\n\nThe statue of Ryerson, which was also attacked last July during Black Lives Matter protests, was vandalised with paint earlier in the week before it was torn down by protesters and subsequently beheaded and thrown into Toronto harbour.\n\nAccording to the Toronto Star, the president of Ryerson University in Toronto Mohamed Lachemi stated on Monday that the university has no plans to replace the statue and said he was relieved that no one had been hurt while toppling the statue.\n\nThe university had already been considering removing the statue and is also investigating possibly renaming Ryerson University as well.\n\nToronto police, meanwhile, have stated that they are investigating the toppling of the statue. Ontario Conservative Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory have yet to make any comment on the toppling of the statue.\n\nThe toppling and beheading of the statue of Egerton Ryerson came nearly a year after a statue of Canada\u2019s first Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald was toppled and beheaded in Montreal last August by far-left activists.\n\nSir John A., like Ryerson, is linked to residential schools and the reported discovery in Kamloops has led to another statue of the former Prime Minister being removed in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island last week.\n\nGreg Rivard, a local councillor in Charlottetown, justified the move saying, \u201cA statue is not history. By removing Sir John A., it\u2019s not removing any history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see some comments on social media [saying] that you can\u2019t erase history, but I don\u2019t think removing a statue erases any history. A statue is symbolic of something, and I don\u2019t think right now that the statue is symbolic of the right things,\u201d he added.",

Leaders of Indigenous groups in Canada say investigators have found more than 600 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school for Indigenous children in Saskatchewan. That follows last month's discovery of about 215 bodies at another such school in British Columbia. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Leaders of Indigenous groups in Canada say investigators have found more than 600 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school for Indigenous children, which follows the discovery of 215 bodies at another school last month.\n\nThe new discovery was at the Marieval Indian Residential School, which operated from 1899 to 1997 where the Cowessess First Nation is now located, about 85 miles (135 kilometers) east of Regina, the capital of the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nGround-penetrating radar registered 751 \u201dhits,\u2033 indicating at least 600 bodies were buried, said Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess. Some and perhaps most are from over a century ago. The gravesite is believed to hold the bodies of children and adults, and even people from outside the community who attended church there.\n\nPerry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said it is not unusual to find such graves at former residential schools but is always a devastating discovery that reopens old wounds about the forced assimilation of native children at those often-abusive institutions.\n\nMany non-Indigenous Canadians were not aware of the extent of the problems at the schools until the remains of 215 children were found last month at what was once the country\u2019s largest such school in British Columbia.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Thousands of children died there of disease and other causes, with many never returned to their families.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which today is the largest Protestant denomination in the country.\n\nThe Canadian government has admitted its role in a century of isolating native children from their homes, families and cultures, and that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, where students were beaten for speaking their native language. That legacy of abuse and isolation has been cited by native leaders as a cause of alcoholism and drug addiction widely seen on reservations today.\n\nIndigenous leaders have called it a form of cultural genocide.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday called it \u201can incredibly harmful government policy that was Canada\u2019s reality for many, many decades and Canadians today are horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved.\u201d\n\nHe said the policy \u201cforced assimilation\u201d on the children.\n\nWHAT\u2019S BEHIND THE DISCOVERY OF THE REMAINS?\n\nA National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was set up as part of a government apology and settlement, issued a report in 2015 that identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools. While some died of diseases like tuberculosis amid the often- deplorable conditions, it noted that a cause of death for about half of them often was not recorded.\n\nThe government wanted to keep costs down at the schools, so adequate regulations were never established, the reconciliation commission said..\n\nIt said the practice at the schools was to not send the bodies home to their communities. Delorme said the graves at the Saskatchewan school were marked at one time, but that the Catholic operators of the facility had removed them.\n\nWHAT APOLOGIES HAVE BEEN MADE?\n\nFormer Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized in Parliament in 2008 for the government\u2019s role. Among the Christian denominations, the Presbyterian, Anglican and United churches also apologized for their roles in the abuse.\n\nA papal apology was one of 94 recommendations from the reconciliation commission, but the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops said in 2018 that the pope could not personally apologize for the residential schools.\n\nFormer Pope Benedict XVI met with some former students and victims in 2009 and told them of his \u201cpersonal anguish\u201d over their suffering.\n\nAfter last month\u2019s discovery, Pope Francis expressed his pain and pressed religious and political authorities to shed light on \u201cthis sad affair,\u201d but didn\u2019t offer an apology.\n\nTrudeau said Friday he has spoken to Francis personally \u201cto impress upon him how important it is not just that he makes an apology but that he makes an apology to indigenous Canadians on Canadian soil.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Don Bolen of the Regina Archdiocese posted a letter on its website this week to the Cowessess First Nation in which he repeated an apology he said he made two years ago.\n\nWHAT COMPENSATION HAS BEEN OFFERED?\n\nThe reconciliation commission was created as part of a $5 billion Canadian ($4 billion U.S.) class action settlement in 2005, the largest in Canadian history.\n\nUnder the settlement, students who attended the schools were eligible to receive $10,000 Canadian ($8,143 U.S.) for the first school year and $3,000 Canadian ($2,443 U.S.) for every year thereafter. Victims of physical and sexual abuse were eligible for further compensation.\n\nTrudeau has said the government will help preserve gravesites and search for unmarked burial grounds at other schools, but he and his ministers have stressed the need for indigenous communities to decide for themselves how they want to proceed.\n\nThe government previously announced $27 million Canadian ($22 million U.S.) for the effort in what it called a first step.",

            "content": "Indigenous people and allies gathered for an Every Child Matters Vigil on Thursday near the water at Alki Beach.\n\nOver the past two months, the remains of 215 children were found in British Columbia near the former Kamloops Residential School which closed in 1978, and 751 more unmarked graves were uncovered in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan near the former Marieval Residential School. These discoveries led many Indigenous communities to protest Canada Day, which is recognized on July 1. Memorials and vigils were held across the U.S. and Canada for people to mourn the losses together.\n\nCrissy Archambault, 35, of North Dakota held her son, Ayden, 4, while listening to Indigenous women sing a healing song in the setting sun. Archambault came to Seattle to visit family and said after hearing about the vigil she had to come to \u201csupport the community.\u201d\n\nLongtime friends Tamara Vining, 67, and Alma G., 70, of the Tepehu\u00e1n community embraced during the vigil. \u201cI expect they will find more of these graves to be found here (in the U.S.)\u201d Alma said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much intergenerational trauma that\u2019s being passed down.\u201d\n\nSocial-justice activist and organizer Roxanne White, a Nez Perce tribal member, passed around a microphone to allow people in the crowd to share their thoughts. White encouraged people to continue holding onto their community and culture during this time of loss.\n\nCommunity organizer Ixtli Salinas-Whitehawk, 45, lit candles at an altar as dozens of luminaries were placed near the beach, orange carnations were set adrift in the water and lanterns floated into the night sky in remembrance of the children.",

            "content": "On Friday, 215 pairs of shoes were placed on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery . Yellow sandals, black Nikes with pink swooshes, and moccasins were scattered amongst flowers and teddy bears. Organized by artist Tamara Bell , it was one of many vigils across Canada in honour of 215 Indigenous children, some as young as three, whose remains were found on the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nBut amid the public mourning was an undertone of too little, too late. Because while some settlers may just be waking up to the realities of colonization and the systemic genocide of Indigenous people, Indigenous communities have been living through this for 500 years.\n\n\u201cIndigenous communities are not surprised by this,\u201d Angela White, executive director of the Indian Residential Schools Survivor Society (IRSSS), tells Refinery29 Canada, noting, as many others have said, that there are likely \u201csimilar unmarked graveyards attached to a vast majority of the residential schools throughout British Columbia and Canada.\u201d White continues, \u201cThe rest of Canada will be shocked by this, because there's always been different narratives regarding Indian residential schools; [but] for the Indigenous community, we\u2019ve heard people's testimonials about their lived experience.\u201d\n\nAs Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond (Aki-Kwe), director of the Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia, wrote in the Globe and Mail . \u201c...we should be sad; it is horrific. But it is not shocking. In fact, it is the opposite \u2014 a too-common unearthing of the legacy, and enduring reality, of colonialism in Canada. To the degree it is shocking, it is evidence of how much learning there is still to do.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s residential school system dates back to the 1870s , when the Catholic Church forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families in an attempt to strip them from their culture. These children were sent to institutions under the guise of education, but instead endured violence as well as physical, mental, and sexual abuse. These schools \u2014 the last of which closed in 1996, only 25 years ago \u2014 created a harmful cycle of intergenerational trauma. The government apologized to former residential school students in 2008\n\nIt\u2019s a history that many Canadians are unfamiliar and unable to grapple with (or unwilling to educate themselves on) because it goes against everything we are taught in history class. \u201cCanada is supposed to be a diverse country and accepting of everyone,\u201d White says. \u201cThis shatters that whole perception of who we are as Canadians, and that hits you at the core.\u201d\n\n\n\n As part of the 2015 TRC findings, the federal government was told that it needs to move from \u201c apology to action ,\u201d and yet \u2014 six years later \u2014 little has actually been done . \u201cSix years ago, we were marching the streets of Ottawa for change with the Truth and Reconciliation [Commission],\u201d White says. \u201cHow many of those recommendations have been implemented? How many have been held up by the bureaucracy that\u2019s slower than a snail?\u201d While she acknowledges that there have been small steps here and there, she points to the clean drinking water crisis and lack of resolution or support for MMIWG , as indicators of how much further we have to go to even begin to think about progress or reconciliation.\n\n\u201cI am constantly fighting [for] more resources,\u201d White adds. \u201cTo put that to the Canadian government and say, \u2018why is it that we as an Indigenous organization at the grassroots level are constantly having to try and fight to fix something that they destroyed?\u2019\n\nOn May 31, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that there will be more support for survivors of residential schools, although what exactly that support looks like is still unclear. Many criticized the Trudeau government for its initial response to last week\u2019s news and for taking almost four days to lower flags on federal buildings to half mast . (It may seem inconsequential, but lowering the flags is a symbol of mourning and respect.)\n\nLooking forward, White says there needs to be an inquiry into the deaths of children at residential schools run by an independent entity, but funded by the government. (FWIW, in 2009 the TRC requested $1.5 million in funding to search for unmarked graves. It was denied under Stephen Harper's government .) \u201cThe basic thing that we can hope for is to acknowledge all of those missing children that did not make it home. And it could be as simple as identifying them and bringing them back to their communities in a way that honours them. That's the least we can do.\u201d",

            "content": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday it \u2019s not an isolated incident that over 200 children were found buried at a former Indigenous residential school.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s comments come as Indigenous leaders are calling for an examination of every former residential school site \u2014 institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were confirmed this month with the help of ground-penetrating radar. She described the discovery as \u201can unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented\u201d at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest such school in the country.\n\n\u201cAs prime minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole Indigenous children from their communities,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not an exception or an isolated incident,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2019We\u2019re not going to hide from that. We have to acknowledge the truth. Residential schools were a reality \u2014 a tragedy that existed here, in our country, and we have to own up to it. Kids were taken from their families, returned damaged or not returned at all.\u201d\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nPlans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the Kamloops site.\n\nTrudeau said he\u2019ll be talking to his ministers about further things his government needs to do to support survivors and the community. Flags at all federal buildings are at half-staff.\n\nOpposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh called Monday afor an emergency debate in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise. This is a reality of residential schools,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201c215 Indigenous kids were found in an unmarked mass grave,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2019Anytime we think about unmarked mass graves, we think about a distant country where a genocide has happened. This is not a distant country.\u201d\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nRichard Gagnon, archbishop of Winnipeg and president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, said he wanted to express \u201cour deepest sorrow for the heartrending loss of the children at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School.\u201d\n\nThe National Truth and Reconciliation Commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963. The Commission identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Some died of tuberculosis. The Commission said the practice was not to send the bodies of the students who died at the schools to their communities. The Commission also said the government wanted to keep costs down so adequate regulations were never established.\n\n\u201cThis discovery is a stain on our country. It is one that needs to be rectified,\u201d Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner said.\n\nEmpty pairs of children\u2019s shoes have been placed at memorials throughout the country.\n\nPerry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, has said while it is not new to find graves at former residential schools, it\u2019s always crushing to have that chapter\u2019s wounds exposed.\n\nThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations and the Saskatchewan government said they want Ottawa to help research undocumented deaths and burials at residential schools in the province.\n\nFederation Chief Bobby Cameron said finding the children\u2019s remains and giving them proper burials is important to help First Nations communities and families find closure. The federation has compiled a list of initial sites where it hopes to complete radar ground searches.\n\nSol Mamakwa, an opposition lawmaker with the New Democrat party in Ontario, also called on the government to search the grounds of other former residential schools.\n\n\u201cIt is a great open secret that our children lie on the properties of former schools. It is an open secret that Canadians can no longer look away from,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "When they came to take Jonnish Saganash away, he was only five years old.\n\nIt was 1954, and the Canadian government had decided he was to be sent to a residential school in Ontario \u2013 hundreds of kilometers from his Indigenous community in Quebec.\n\n\u201cHe was just a child, a gentle child born on the land of his ancestors,\u201d his brother Romeo recalled this week.\n\nJust a year after arriving at the school, Jonnish contracted rheumatic fever and died far from his family. He was buried in an unmarked grave near the school.\n\nLast week, news broke at the other end of the country that would bring all those painful memories back. It was \u201cdevastating \u2013 again,\u201d said Romeo.\n\nTk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc, an Indigenous nation in British Columbia, announced they had uncovered evidence of unmarked graves containing the remains of as many as 215 Indigenous children behind the site of a former residential school in the city of Kamloops.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,\u201d said K\u00fakpi7 (chief) Rosanne Casimir in a statement. \u201cSome were as young as three.\u201d\n\nThe news came as a shock to many Canadians, but it shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nIndigenous people, especially those who survived the schools, have known for years that unmarked graves of their relatives dot the country. And Canada, they have said, is doing precious little about it.\n\nThe news from Kamloops has had Saganash thinking about those friends he lost in the 10 years he spent at La Tuque Indian residential school in Quebec.\n\n\u201cThose who disappeared or never made it home, those I knew were abused physically, sexually, spiritually,\u201d Saganash wrote in an email. \u201cTheir eyes and look flashed in my memory, the things they said to me without uttering a word. The cries for help without tears. Those memories will stay with me all my life.\u201d\n\nBetween 1867 and 1996, the Canadian state abducted more than 150,000 Indigenous children from their parents and forced them into these schools as part of a campaign of forced assimilation. Thousands were subject to physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\n\nAccording to the official register, 3,213 died. The real number is certainly much higher.\n\nFor decades, the mortality rate for Indigenous children in these schools ranged between twice as high and five times higher than non-Indigenous schoolchildren. Suicide, neglect and disease all contributed to the devastating loss of life.\n\nRoughly 900 students died of tuberculosis in the schools. More than 150 would die of influenza and a similar number of pneumonia. In hundreds of other cases, a cause of death is unknown.\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza pandemic, the principal of one Alberta school wrote in a letter to the department: \u201cWe have no isolation ward and no hospital equipment of any kind. The dead, the dying, and the sick and the convalescent were all together.\u201d He called the conditions \u201ccriminal\u201d.\n\nMemories remain vivid for many survivors. Shirley Leon recalled seeing cattle trucks driving on to her reserve as a child \u2013 and then \u201cseeing my cousins cry and then they were put on these trucks, and hauled off \u2013 we didn\u2019t know where\u201d, she told an inquiry decades later. Soon, the government would come for her, too: she attended the Kamloops school in the 1940s.\n\nSome schools were government-run; others were administered by the church. All shared one central mission.\n\nOne official wrote in 1910 that those schools were \u201cgeared towards the final solution of our Indian Problem\u201d. In practice, that meant stripping Indigenous students of their culture, language \u2013 and everything that made them Indigenous.\n\nThere is another name for that program: a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which spent five years hearing the stories of survivors from those schools, described it as \u201ccultural genocide\u201d.\n\nAnother witness, Ray Silver, told the commission about his time at the Alberni Indian residential school, in British Columbia. His brother, Dalton, fell ill, but Silver was not told. \u201cHe was a little guy, lying in the bed in the infirmary, dying, and I didn\u2019t know \u2019til he died.\u201d\n\nThe commission\u2019s report was published in 2015 to great fanfare, and came accompanied by 94 calls to action \u2013 steps Canada must take in order to reckon with its ugly past and do right by the 1.7 million Indigenous people in the country, who consistently see lower health, education and economic outcomes.\n\nThe commission also identified 20 unmarked gravesites at former residential schools across the country. But, the commissioners wrote, \u201cit is apparent that there are likely to be other unidentified residential gravesites across the country.\u201d A national program, they wrote, \u201cis required to complete the task of identifying the many unmarked residential school cemeteries and gravesites across Canada\u201d.\n\nThe report was heralded as a watershed moment for the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. But optimism has given way to frustration over a lack of progress and an apparent lack of ambition from the federal government.\n\nIn late 2019 the Yellowhead Institute \u2013 a First Nations-led research centre based at Ryerson University in Toronto, a school named for Egerton Ryerson, a colonial official and a chief architect of the residential school system \u2013 reported that just nine of the 94 calls to action had been fully addressed. In a 2020 report card, the Assembly of First Nations said there had been only \u201cmoderate progress\u201d on identifying all of the children who died in those schools.\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about reconciliation, a term that has been so abused by the governments that no Indigenous person wants to hear that word any more, then our actions need to show that we are sincere and genuine,\u201d Saganash said. \u201cThat is not happening.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the government of Justin Trudeau is currently fighting a class action lawsuit, seeking reparations for the broader effort to destroy Indigenous language, culture and identity.\n\nMany Indigenous peoples are similarly vexed by Ottawa\u2019s lack of progress in addressing Canada\u2019s epidemic of violence against Indigenous women.\n\nSaganash, who was elected to parliament in 2011 as a member of the centre-left New Democratic party, fought for years for the creation of an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. But its calls to action have similarly been addressed in piecemeal fashion.\n\nIf confirmed, the grim discovery in Kamloops would be one of the most significant discoveries in recent years. With support from the BC government, the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc hired a ground-penetrating radar specialist. While a final study will be needed, Casimir said the preliminary results mean they can \u201cbegin the process of honouring the lost loved ones who are in our caretaking\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot acting,\u201d to uncover the rest of those sites, Saganash said, \u201cwill be just an invitation to relive the trauma every year or so, as we slowly discover other sites.\u201d\n\nSaganash\u2019s family found Jonnish\u2019s grave almost purely by chance, after his sister met a supervisor from the school who remembered him.\n\n\u201cWhen we asked my late mom, after finding her son 40 years later, if she would like the little body to be brought home,\u201d Saganash recalled. \u201cShe responded: \u2018It is not necessary, because I will be with him one day again.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "Members of the St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in Surrey, British Columbia, were shocked to discover that the church burned to the ground on Monday morning, the latest in a rash of church burnings and vandalism across Canada in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an extremely tragic and difficult event for us to grasp and to wrap our heads around,\u201d Steven Faltas, a board member for St. George, told National Review. \u201cSomewhere between 300 and 400 families attended this church quite regularly, with nearly daily services and activities being offered. So for it to overnight not be there anymore has been extremely difficult for us to deal with and to absorb.\u201d\n\nSeveral churches have burned to the ground in Canada in recent weeks, with additional churches and a statue of St. John Paul vandalized. The incidents were perpetrated from British Columbia all the way to Nova Scotia.\n\nThe burnings and vandalism began after First Nation tribes discovered unmarked graves at the sites of former so-called Indian residential schools. These schools were established in the 1830s to assimilate indigenous children into Canadian society, and some continued to operate until the 1990s.\n\nA 2015 government commission found that the residential-schools system constituted a \u201ccultural genocide,\u201d and former pupils have detailed allegations of sexual and physical abuse at the schools. Over 1,000 unmarked graves were discovered by various tribes over the past several months.\n\nA majority of the schools were operated by the Catholic Church in Canada. Most of the churches that have burned to the ground since the discoveries of unmarked graves were Catholic, such as the 100-year-old St. Jean Baptiste Church in Morinville, Alberta.\n\nHowever, the St. George Coptic Church fire is unusual in that the church has no connection to the Indian residential-school program.\n\n\u201cThe Coptic Orthodox church . . . doesn\u2019t have an affiliation with the residential-school program,\u201d Faltas said. \u201cThe Coptic church in Vancouver is approximately 30 years old so, based on the timeline that I\u2019m aware of, that\u2019s quite a few years after the residential-school program was stopped.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the burning remain murky. An unidentified white woman set fire to a wreath on the church door on July 14, in footage captured by a surveillance camera. The fact that the church burned down several days later has raised suspicions of arson: \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think that these two instances have some commonalities,\u201d Faltas commented.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police in Surrey did not respond to National Review\u2019s request for comment in time for publication. The RCMP has already termed the fires at St. George and other churches as \u201csuspicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe RCMP is tracking/investigating these crimes where we are the police of jurisdiction,\u201d RCMP spokesperson Robin Percival told the Daily Caller on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all levels of government for assistance, knowing that we\u2019ve been innocent bystanders to a political mess that we weren\u2019t involved with,\u201d Faltas said.\n\nFaltas added that the Coptic community in Surrey would regroup following the burning.\n\n\u201cAs believers we rely on our scripture and the word of God to remind us of the promises He has made,\u201d Faltas said. \u201cAnd even though today might be a day of mourning, tomorrow will be a day of joy.\u201d\n\nSend a tip to the news team at NR.",

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that residential schools for Canada\u2019s Indigenous children were part of a larger colonial policy designed to erase language and culture and to assimilate those groups so they no longer existed as distinct peoples.\n\nTrudeau said the discovery of 215 children found buried at a former Indigenous residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, is part of a larger tragedy. The institutions held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children were confirmed last month with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\n\u201cChildren should never have been sent to those so-called schools \u2014 places where they were separated from their families and their communities, places where they faced terrible loneliness, places where they suffered unthinkable abuse,\u201d Trudeau said in an emergency debate in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThat is the fault of Canada.\u201d\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nPlans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the Kamloops site. Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said he spoke with Trudeau on Tuesday and urged him to work with First Nations \u201cto find all the unmarked graves of out stolen children\u201d in Canada.\n\nA National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was set up as part of a government apology and settlement over the schools, issued a report in 2015 and Bellegarde urged Trudeau to accelerate implementing its recommendations. Trudeau has said he would implement them and said government has put in place the legislation to strengthen Indigenous languages and culture.\n\nMurray Sinclair, the former chair of the reconciliation commission, said more sites will be found.\n\n\u201cWe know there are lots of sites similar to Kamloops that are going to come to light in the future. We need to begin to prepare ourselves for that,\u201d Sinclair said.\n\nSinclair said the stories about children who died in the schools during the commission\u2019s work was shocking and said survivors talked about children being \u201cburied in large numbers into mass burial sites.\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963. It identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools throughout Canada but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Some died of tuberculosis.\n\nThe commission said the practice was not to send the bodies of the students who died at the schools to their communities. It also said the government wanted to keep costs down so adequate regulations were never established.\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential School was Canada\u2019s largest such facility operated by the Roman Catholic Church between 1890 and 1969 before the federal government took it over as a day school until 1978, when it was closed.\n\n\u201cIt was the most horrible pain in the world to be a native, to be an Indian back then,\u201d said Clayton Peters, who spent seven years at the school.\n\nPeters and his brothers were forcibly taken to the school in 1967. He remembers thinking that kids who suddenly disappeared from there were lucky because they had managed to escape, saying his unsuccessful attempt to get away led to harsh consequences.\n\n\u201cI always thought they ran away like I did, that they made it, that they were free,\u201d he said crying.\n\nNow, he thinks some of the children he knew may be buried at the site.",

            "summary": "\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that residential schools for Canada\u2019s Indigenous children were part of a larger colonial policy designed to erase language and culture and to assimilate those groups so they no longer existed as distinct peoples. \n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children were confirmed last month with the help of ground-penetrating radar.\n\n\u201cChildren should never have been sent to those so-called schools \u2014 places where they were separated from their families and their communities, places where they faced terrible loneliness, places where they suffered unthinkable abuse,\u201d Trudeau said in an emergency debate in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThat is the fault of Canada.\u201d\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. We need to begin to prepare ourselves for that,\u201d Sinclair said.\n\nSinclair said the stories about children who died in the schools during the commission\u2019s work was shocking and said survivors talked about children being \u201cburied in large numbers into mass burial sites.\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963. It identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools throughout Canada but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them.",

            "content": "Indigenous groups have called for Canada\u2019s national celebration to be cancelled over the discovery of more than 1,000 unmarked graves, most of which are believed to belong to Indigenous children.\n\nJuly 1 marks 154 years since Canada became a country \u2013 and until recently, festivities in cities across the country were expected, amplified by the arrival of summer and the pent-up excitement of a country emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut three grim discoveries on the grounds of former residential schools have quickly shifted the national mood.\n\n\u201cWe will not celebrate stolen Indigenous land and stolen indigenous lives. Instead we will gather to honour all of the lives lost to the Canadian state,\u201d said the group Idle No More, calling for national rallies to support Indigenous communities.\n\nOver the course of 100 years, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society. They were given new names, forcibly converted to Christianity and prohibited from speaking their native languages. Thousands died of disease, neglect and suicide; many were never returned to their families. The last residential school closed in 1996. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which is today the largest Protestant denomination in the country. In 2015, a historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission which concluded that the residential school system amounted to a policy of cultural genocide. Survivor testimony made it clear that sexual, emotional and physical abuse were rife at the schools. And the trauma suffered by students was often passed down to younger generations \u2013 a reality magnified by systematic inequities that persist across the country. Dozens of First Nations do not have access to drinking water, and racism against Indigenous people is rampant within the healthcare system. Indigenous people are overrepresented in federal prisons and Indigenous women are killed at a rate far higher than other groups. The commissioners identified 20 unmarked gravesites at former residential schools, but they also warned that more unidentified gravesites were yet to be found across the country. Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAt least 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend the notorious schools. They were given new names, forcibly converted to Christianity and prohibited from speaking their native languages. The last residential school closed in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThis coming Canada Day, I think we all need to pledge ourselves to doing what we can to continue that effort to make Canada better, all the while respecting and listening to those for whom it\u2019s not yet a day of celebration,\u201d said Justin Trudeau last week.\n\nThe hashtag #CancelCanadaDay has taken off on social media, with many suggesting that celebrations and fireworks displays are out of touch with the dawning reality that more unmarked graves still await discovery.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really understand how much Indigenous people were forced to pay to this country. Our spirituality was taken away. Our way of life, our languages and our families were taken away. With the remains we continue to find, people are beginning to see that Indigenous people paid in full \u2013 with their lives,\u201d said Sol Mamakwa, an Ontario lawmaker from Kingfisher Lake First Nation.\n\nInstead of celebrating, Mamakwa has asked Canadians to spend the day reflecting and mourning the children who never returned home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we acknowledge this history, the pain and what was done to Indigenous people in this country.\u201d\n\nSome cities have outright cancelled their celebrations, while others have planned events that will reflect a sombre national mood.\n\nVictoria, British Columbia became the first city to cancel its Canada Day programming, announcing it would consult with the Lekwungen community and broadcast celebrations with local artists later in the summer.\n\nAcross the country in the city of Fredricton, officials say the city will be lit orange \u2013 the colour largely tied to Canada\u2019s residential school history \u2013 and is urging citizens to spend the day learning about Indigenous communities.\n\nThe city of Dawson has said it will donate all funds earmarked for Canada Day celebrations to an investigation into residential schools in the Yukon Territory.\n\nA recent poll commissioned by the conservative National Post suggested the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Canadians want to keep the holiday and that calls to re-think the holiday reflected the siloed thinking of social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that injustices in our past or in the present are too often seized upon by a small group of activist voices who use it to attack the very idea of Canada itself,\u201d said Conservative leader Erin O\u2019Toole last week. \u201cWe are seeing news this week of Canada Day celebrations being cancelled. Canada Day, our day of celebration, when Canadians of every background come together to give thanks for living in the greatest country in the world.\u201d\n\nDespite the heavy emotional toll the findings over the last month have had on communities, Mamakwa feels optimistic Canadians are finally reckoning with the country\u2019s dark past.\n\n\u201cThe oppression, the colonialism, the genocide and the crimes against humanity: people are learning their government, their churches and their police did this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people finally know the real history of this country \u2013 because it\u2019s our shared history.\u201d",

            "content": "After the recent discovery of hundreds of Indigenous children\u2019s unmarked graves at former Canadian residential schools, Drezus \u2013 an rapper of Cree and Ojibwe heritage from the Muskowekwan First Nation in Saskatchewan province \u2013 grew unsure about his longstanding plans to release a new music video, Bless. He starts the song by calling the atrocities his people have faced \u201can act of war\u201d, then follows that with bar after bar of Indigenous empowerment. Unsure if that would be appropriate while his people grieved, he turned to his mother, who had attended one of those schools. Her advice? \u201cRelease it, son. We need it now.\u201d\n\nThis government-funded, Christian church-administered boarding school system was established in Canada in the late 1800s. Its founders\u2019 intent: to forcibly remove Indigenous children from their \u201csavage\u201d parents and impose English and Christianity. Some 150,000 Indigenous children attended these schools before the last one closed in 1997. In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report detailed nearly 38,000 sexual and physical abuse claims from former residential school students, along with 3,200 documented deaths. The mortality rate for those children was estimated to be up to five times higher than their white counterparts, due to factors including suicide, neglect and disease.\n\nA greater reckoning did not occur until this summer, however, when radar was used to discover over 1,000 children\u2019s unmarked graves at former residential school sites in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Seeing such news has often caused Drezus to \u201cbreak down in the past few weeks, when I look over at my family and think about what those children and their parents went through\u201d. It also prompted him to tweet: \u201cTo grow up Native is to grow up grieving. Even when you don\u2019t know you are.\u201d\n\nBorn Jeremiah Manitopyes, the 38-year-old rapper also went to a residential school in the village of Lebret from 1996-97, a year before it closed. By then, it was operated not by the church but local Indigenous counsellors, who, he says \u201cwere not abusive. They were like our uncles, or big bros.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Drezus still suffered trauma there during a hazing ritual, when he was among younger boys forced to wear shirts emblazoned with targets before they were chased by the older students. Once caught, they would be stripped and shoved into a lineup in front of the girl\u2019s dormitory. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers and paramedics were at the door, as if \u201cthey were standing by, just in case\u201d, he recalls. He adds: \u201cI remember the smile on the RCMP\u2019s face, almost high-fiving me, like, \u2018Fun night, huh?\u2019 Everyone acted like it was in good fun. But thinking back now on how messed up it was, I can\u2019t help but wonder: did this tradition come from something evil?\u201d\n\nDrezus says his grandmother\u2019s generation contended with worse. She had to cook elaborate meals for staff, while she and her fellow Indigenous students were fed only porridge soup slop. His mother and uncle, meanwhile, were not permitted to sit next to each other at lunch or play together. \u201cShe said it was dead quiet in class all the time, because if a kid spoke, they got a whooping. And speaking their own language was of course taboo.\u201d Drezus sees direct parallels between those conditions and the mental health and addiction issues afflicting young Indigenous people he has worked with across Canada in his hip-hop workshops. \u201cI\u2019ll see these kids turn from a closed-off person to rapping, singing and laughing. A lot of kids are completely shut down when it comes to social expression and being in touch with themselves. Because we lost a lot of that celebration of ourselves in these schools.\u201d\n\nOther Indigenous rappers also spoke out on social media immediately after the discovery of the graves. For years, these artists have addressed myriad issues gripping their communities \u2013 from rising suicide and imprisonment rates, to the lack of clean drinking water on Indigenous reserves, along with a crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, not to mention waves of Indigenous anti-pipeline protests.\n\nOne of the scene\u2019s forebears is HellnBack (Karmen Omeasoo), who has been rapping for 31 years. The Cree Nation-born, Manitoba-based MC\u2019s latest single Kidney Warrior details his struggles with kidney failure (he is currently searching for a donor). He aims to raise awareness about the affliction disproportionately affecting Indigenous people in Canada, due to a dearth of affordable healthy food in their communities, among other factors. He and his hand-drummer wife Lisa Muswagon will also address the residential school graves on a forthcoming album. A transcriber for the TRC report, Muswagon heard various accounts of residential school conditions, while HellnBack saw the effects of residential schooling on his grandmother who, as an elderly woman, was so triggered during visits from door-to-door evangelical Christians that she pretended not to speak English. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a hateful person, but she didn\u2019t want to put up with it any more,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, unlike much of non-Indigenous Canada and the rest of the world, the couple was not caught off guard by this summer\u2019s news. \u201cThis will only get worse as they search more school sites. All we can do is pray and smudge,\u201d HellnBack says, referring to the ceremony for which Indigenous peoples burn purifying sacred herbs. If those prayers are answered, then \u201cfamilies that were affected will finally know, rather than having to guess what happened.\u201d\n\nHe also takes care to rap about earlier atrocities \u2013 the title track from his 2018 LP, #Fourteen91, describes colonisers bearing smallpox-infested blankets \u2013 and these deep dives are also a highlight of Eekwol\u2019s discography. One of the first female rappers in Saskatchewan\u2019s small music scene, the MC born Lindsay Knight (of that province\u2019s Muskoday First Nation) has penned songs including 2004\u2019s Too Sick, which nimbly connects current domestic violence in Indigenous communities to early colonialism. That song helped her consider \u201cintergenerational trauma\u201d so she could clearly see \u201cthat\u2019s why this relative drinks, or this neighbour was abused. Because trauma comes out as despair,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd yet she insists those tragedies shouldn\u2019t stifle stories of Indigenous perseverance. Instead, Eekwol would rather call attention to a multitude of female and LGBTQ Indigenous artists\u2019 \u201cpowerful social commentary. It\u2019s not a positive message, because the negative stories are true. But instead of dwelling on that, we are taking what we can and building it into a form of power.\u201d\n\nThat notion is seconded by T-Rhyme (Tara Campbell), a rapper with Denesuline and Northern Cree roots whom Eekwol has likened to a sister since they banded together for projects such as their 2019 album FWBW. \u201cThe focus doesn\u2019t always need to be on our trauma, even though we are constantly triggered by the news lately,\u201d T-Rhyme says. \u201cBut nobody can gaslight us any more \u2013 this is proof that we were [deliberately] forgotten.\u201d Whenever her mother recounted being taken to a residential school as a child, and only being permitted to return for two annual holidays, T-Rhyme couldn\u2019t \u201cfathom somebody knocking on my door to take my six-year-old son until Christmas, and trust that they\u2019d take care of him. It wasn\u2019t until my kids reached that age that I processed what my mom and grandparents went through.\u201d She also has trouble fathoming the recent headlines because \u201cthose babies should have grandchildren of their own now. But we Indigenous people that are still here raising our children have to keep fighting the good fight, and not only process grief but celebrate resilience.\u201d\n\nFWBW features the uplifting tracks For Women by Women, and Revitalize, whose video features \u201cpow wows and ceremonies that show how our people are strong; that represent our Indigenous pride,\u201d says T-Rhyme. One of her most powerful lines on Revitalize is: \u201cLanguage is our seed and we\u2019re growing through the pavement.\u201d\n\nThis is also a painfully crucial point for T-Rhyme\u2019s friend and occasional stage-mate Drezus, who raps on Bless: \u201cThey want to take my language / That\u2019s an act of war.\u201d He recalls how his grandmother, who was barred from speaking her mother tongue at residential school, \u201cspoke it when I was growing up. But it was broken.\u201d Now he makes sure to end many social media posts with \u201cMiigwetch!\u201d, which means \u201cthank you\u201d in his mother tongue. He also captioned a recent Instagram photo of him and his child: \u201cI have been hugging my babies extra tight lately. And I low-key wish my Kokum\u201d \u2013 grandma \u2013 \u201cwas alive to see the uprising.\u201d Rapping, he says, allowed him to \u201cremove the layers of mental health issues, addiction and self-doubt. Hip-hop gave me this voice, led me to the real me and my culture, and gave me the confidence to look deep into myself.\u201d\n\nHis rallying cry Warpath caught the attention of Black Eyed Peas\u2019 member Taboo, who invited Drezus to the Standing Rock protests and collaborated with him on Stand Up/Stand N Rock, which won the Best Fight Against the System trophy at the 2017 MTV Video Music awards. Drezus fondly recalls sitting near DJ Khaled at the LA ceremony, and watching Cardi B perform Bodak Yellow. \u201cFor a kid from Saskatchewan to make it all the way to the VMAs? I started tripping.\u201d\n\nAnother highlight was his collaboration with Grammy-winning Indigenous producer David Strickland on his remix of posse cut Rez Life, a reserve ode originally created by up-and-comers Violent Ground, a duo from the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach in the isolated northern borderlands of Quebec and Labrador. Drezus\u2019s lyrics include a reference to being \u201cput in a chokehold\u201d by RCMP officers: the now-sober rapper was inebriated to the point of defencelessness when the Mounties stopped him, but \u201cthey still beat my ass. There was obviously more to it than them just doing their job\u201d.\n\n\n\nRez Life was not only cathartic for Drezus, but also Strickland (not to mention the song\u2019s other contributors: HellnBack, Joey Stylez, Que Rock and Violent Ground). Born in suburban Toronto, the Mi\u2019kmaw producer and engineer became known for studio work with Method Man and Drake (winning a Grammy as one of the engineers for the latter\u2019s Take Care). After those mainstream successes, he trained his hip-hop skills on Indigenous culture, mentoring and supporting many of the community\u2019s socially conscious MCs. His breakthrough was the 2020 compilation Spirit of Hip Hop, with traditional drummers and singers, and lyrics about Indigenous life from a who\u2019s who of the community\u2019s MCs. \n\n\n\n\u201cOnce they start learning, many non-Indigenous Canadians fight alongside us, because most of them are good people and don\u2019t want anyone to suffer,\u201d Strickland tells me. He longs for that allyship and activism to be galvanised by the discovery of the graves, and for reserves\u2019 lack of key resources to be improved: \u201cHow can we allow reserves to have to boil their water? Can you imagine trying to shower with that?\u201d He adds that addressing such issues will also benefit Canada\u2019s global standing now that the residential school graves have made international news.\n\nThose recent headlines will be addressed on a forthcoming Strickland-helmed track by Violent Ground. The producer first met brothers Christian and Allan Nabinacaboo \u2013 AKA Naskapi9 and Nomadic \u2013 when he stopped at their far north reserve on a beat-making workshop tour. Strickland\u2019s support has been invaluable for the duo who, according to Naskapi9, \u201cdidn\u2019t even know you could learn how to make beats from YouTube\u201d until very recently because of their isolated community\u2019s lack of high-speed internet.\n\n\u201cEvery time something hurts me, I go into my little booth and don\u2019t think about anything but my lyrics, and how I want to express that pain,\u201d Nomadic says. And when this summer\u2019s news about residential schools made him think about his aunties and uncles who studied at such institutions: \u201cI wrote right away about how I felt about it in my lyrics.\u201d\n\nViolent Ground\u2019s forthcoming Strickland collaboration is called Conquer. Naskapi9 says it is the perfect title: \u201cThey conquered us before. But now we can conquer any challenge.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA Times Canada correspondent recalls how meeting an Indigenous chef gave him a powerful and belated history lesson about Canada\u2019s mistreatment of Indigenous people.\n\nAn Indigenous boy raped by a priest and forced by another to scrub away the brown from his knuckles until they bled. These images haunted me this week as I reported on the discovery in Saskatchewan of the remains of as many as 751 people, many of them children, on the verdant lands of an Indigenous group. [Read: Hundreds More Unmarked Graves Found at Former Residential School in Canada] The boy was Solomon Wawatay, now 63, a survivor of a residential school in Quebec and the father of Cezin Nottaway, a charismatic chef who gave me my long overdue Indigenous education. Like the children whose remains were discovered this week, Mr. Wawatay was among the 150,000 Indigenous children who passed through one of the church-run schools between 1883 and 1996. Many later said they were sexually, emotionally and physically abused, and barred from speaking their languages. Others vanished, their parents left to ponder their fates.\n\n[Read: How Thousands of Indigenous Children Vanished in Canada] The Saskatchewan discovery \u2014 just weeks after a similar finding of unmarked graves in British Columbia \u2014 was a chilling reminder of Canada\u2019s longstanding mistreatment of Indigenous people. It also recalled our country\u2019s historical amnesia when it comes to taking responsibility for Indigenous suffering. When I was growing up in Montreal in the 1980s, my first encounter with Indigenous people came in my high school history text book where we learned how 17th-century French settlers in what is now Quebec encountered fierce resistance from the Iroquois nation, who were portrayed as barbaric warriors. While I went on to study history at university and learned about the perils of minority voices being silenced, it was only after I returned to Canada about four years ago that I had a vital, belated history lesson when reporting a profile of Ms. Nottaway, an Indigenous chef. She told me about how she had turned to her grandmothers\u2019 moose meat and rabbit recipes for healing and cultural affirmation.\n\nOn Friday, still shaken by the Saskatchewan story, I called her and her father, Solomon Wawatay, and asked them how the week\u2019s events had affected them. Mr. Wawatay told me that the discovery had stirred difficult memories. In the 1960s, he had been removed from his parents at the age of 6 and sent to a residential school in Amos, in northwestern Quebec. There, at the age of 8, he said, he was raped by a priest in his 30s. \u201cI was only a child. I kept it hidden because I didn\u2019t want to be made fun of,\u201d he told me, sobbing. \u201cHe was never prosecuted or faced punishment.\u201d He also recalled an incident when another priest had forced him to scrub his knuckles until they bled, recalling that he had said, \u201cGet that dirty color off your hand, you dirty Indian!\u201d Mr. Wawatay said he was also beaten. At the school, Mr. Wawatay said he and other Indigenous children weren\u2019t allowed to speak their native Algonquin language. So they would sneak away to the forest to snare rabbits and speak Algonquin among themselves, away from the prying eyes of the priests. He finally left the school at 13, but Mr. Wawatay said his experiences there remained with him and other survivors, some of whom used alcohol to try to numb the pain. He said the parents of children who had been taken away were also deeply traumatized.\n\nMr. Wawatay said: \u201cSome parents drank because their kids were gone. Many had feared that if they didn\u2019t send their kids to the schools, they would be arrested. As a result of the residential schools, we had social problems like malnutrition, dirty diapers, alcoholism.\u201d Ms. Nottaway recalled that her mother, Suzanne Nottaway, had scars on her body from repeated whippings at a residential school. She was so emotionally shaken when the younger Ms. Nottaway was growing up that she struggled to say, \u201cI love you.\u201d Her father, she added, had turned to alcohol and became indescribably sad. \u201cWe are responsible to help our parents by carrying the pain that they endured,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is not the past. As this week reminded us, the repercussions are still happening.\u201d Today Suzanne Nottaway works in a prison where she teaches inmates about Indigenous culture, while Mr. Wawatay is a leader of his community. Suzanne Nottaway with her grandchildren (from left): Quill, Willow and Ryder in Kitigan Zibi, Quebec, in 2019. For Mr. Wawatay, healing gradually began in his 40s, he told me, after an elder told him to let go of the pain and draw strength from the traditions of his ancestors. It is a lesson he has passed on to his children and grandchildren. \u201cAll my high school years, I walked on eggs until my elders taught me that this is my land, this is our way of life, and I began to defend myself that way,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt takes strength to forgive and I did it before, but this week brought back a lot of anger,\u201d he added.\n\nHe told me he hoped the latest revelations would be a catalyst for expanding Indigenous rights, including gaining autonomy over their lands. On his people\u2019s land, he said, white hunters routinely trespassed during moose-hunting season, forcing the community to set up road blocks. Ms. Nottaway added her hope that news of the graves would shake Canada out of its historical complacency, and prod a new national reckoning about the past. \u201cIn the past they took our voices away,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut now Canada can no longer hide from it. Are you going to deny the bones of children?\u201d",

It also recalled our country\u2019s historical amnesia when it comes to taking responsibility for Indigenous suffering. When I was growing up in Montreal in the 1980s, my first encounter with Indigenous people came in my high school history text book where we learned how 17th-century French settlers in what is now Quebec encountered fierce resistance from the Iroquois nation, who were portrayed as barbaric warriors. At the school, Mr. Wawatay said he and other Indigenous children weren\u2019t allowed to speak their native Algonquin language.",

            "content": "Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were confirmed this month with the help of ground-penetrating radar. She described the discovery as \u201can unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented\u201d at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest such school in the country.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s comments come as Indigenous leaders are calling for an examination of every former residential school site \u2014 institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday it\u2019s not an isolated incident that over 200 children were found buried at a former Indigenous residential school.\n\n\u201cAs Prime Minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole Indigenous children from their communities,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not an exception or an isolated incident,'' he said. \u2018\u2019We\u2019re not going to hide from that. We have to acknowledge the truth. Residential schools were a reality - a tragedy that existed here, in our country, and we have to own up to it. Kids were taken from their families, returned damaged or not returned at all.\"\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nThe Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.\n\nIndigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.\n\nPlans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the Kamloops site.\n\nTrudeau said he\u2019ll be talking to his ministers on Monday about further things his government needs to do to support survivors and the community. Flags at all federal buildings are at half-staff.\n\nOpposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh called Monday for an emergency debate in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise. This is a reality of residential schools,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201c215 Indigenous kids were found in an unmarked mass grave,'' he said. \u2018\u2019Anytime we think about unmarked mass graves, we think about a distant country where a genocide has happened. This is not a distant country.\u201d\n\nThe Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.\n\nThe National Truth and Reconciliation Commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963. The Commission identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Some died of tuberculosis. The Commission said the practice was not to send the bodies of the students who died at the schools to their communities. The Commission also said the government wanted to keep costs down so adequate regulations were never established.\n\n\u201cThis discovery is a stain on our country. It is one that needs to be rectified,\u201d Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner said.\n\nPerry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, has said while it is not new to find graves at former residential schools, it\u2019s always crushing to have that chapter\u2019s wounds exposed.\n\nSol Mamakwa, an opposition lawmaker with the New Democrat party in Ontario, called on the governments of Canada and Ontario to search the grounds of other former residential schools.\n\n\u201cIt is a great open secret that our children lie on the properties of former schools. It is an open secret that Canadians can no longer look away from,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "An Indigenous Canadian group announced plans Saturday to identify the remains of 215 children, some as young as three, found buried at the site of a former residential school, per CBC News.\n\nThe big picture: The discovery of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation children's remains has renewed calls for the Roman Catholic Church to apologize for its role in Canada's policy of the 19th and 20th centuries that saw Indigenous children removed from families to attend state-funded residential schools.\n\u2022 Many of the almost 150,000 children attending the schools from 1883 to 1996 to \"assimilate\" into white Canadian society encountered neglect and abuse, as their native languages and cultures were forbidden, the Washington Post reports.\n\u2022 Canada's government apologized in 2008, admitting that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was widespread.\n\nDetails: Tk'emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation Chief Rosanne Casimir said in a statement announcing the discovery Thursday, \"To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths.\"\n\u2022 She said in a later statement that more bodies could be uncovered as not all areas had been searched at the Kamloops Indian Residential School \u2014 which the Catholic Church ran from 1890 to 1969 before the Canadian government took over its administration until the school's closure in 1978.\n\u2022 Assembly of First Nations regional chief Terry Teegee told the CBC that forensic experts would join the BC Coroners Service and the Royal B.C. Museum for the identification.\n\u2022 Prime Minister Trudeau tweeted Friday that the discovery was \"a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country's history.\"\n\nOf note: The Roman Catholic Church has declined to apologize for its role in what Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found in 2015 to be cultural genocide, despite Trudeau writing to Pope Francis to ask for one.\n\u2022 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has urged the pope to apologize, but First Nations Child and Family Caring Society executive director Cindy Blackstock noted Friday that the \"Catholic Church has yet to do that, and to really accept full responsibility for reparations to families,\" per CTV News.\n\u2022 \"So that's something that we need to look into the Catholic Church to be doing, to accept that\" accountability, Blackstock said.\n\nWhat they're saying: Archbishop of Vancouver J. Michael Miller said in a statement to CTV News,\"[W]e pledge to do whatever we can to heal that suffering.\"\n\nBetween the lines: While it's not yet known how the children died, \"accidents, fires and contagious illness at residential schools all contributed to a high death toll, which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has estimated at more than 4,000 children,\" the Washington Post notes.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.",

Michael Miller said in a statement to CTV News,\"[W]e pledge to do whatever we can to heal that suffering.\"\n\nBetween the lines: While it's not yet known how the children died, \"accidents, fires and contagious illness at residential schools all contributed to a high death toll, which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has estimated at more than 4,000 children,\" the Washington Post notes.",

            "content": "\u201cEvery community says that only half of the kids that went away to boarding schools came back\u2026Of those kids who were killed, tortured, slaved, there\u2019s a good guess there were many killed\u2014and how do you hide that?\u201d White said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re finding that out in Kamloops right now.\u201d\n\nThere were at least 367 boarding schools across the U.S., run by the government and churches, operating from the 1860s to the late 1970s. Like in Canada, the point was to forcibly assimilate Indigenous people, who were subjected to sweeping sexual and physical abuses and harsh punishments for speaking their languages and expressing their identities.\n\nIn Minnesota, nearly a quarter of all kids in care are Indigenous, but make up less than 2 percent of the total child population, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association. \u201cI always say we are the orphans and descendants of all the things that were done to us,\u201d White said. \u201cThe conditions we\u2019re living with today are all the remnants of what happened to us through colonial processes, policies, and procedures.\u201d\n\nIn the fall, then House Representative Deb Haaland (who is now Interior Secretary in President Joe Biden\u2019s cabinet) introduced the Truth and Healing Commission on the Indian Boarding School Policy Act, which would have launched an U.S. version of Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The bill failed that session, so NABS is now working with officials to reintroduce it in the summer.\n\nMcCleave said a truth commission would also allow for a full examination into federal policies that removed children from their homes and assimilated them, amounting to genocide. Ideally, the commission would also force the government to hand over boarding school records, so that groups like NABS can access and compile more information, including students\u2019 identities and the number of students who were forced to attend the schools or who died or went missing.\n\nIn Canada, testimony from 6,000 residential school survivors and relatives cemented Canada\u2019s ugly history in the TRC\u2019s final reports, and informed 94 calls to action, such as safeguarding the opportunity for Indigenous people to learn their languages and to hire more Indigenous people in health care. Only eight calls have been fully implemented since the findings were first published more than five years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating too. It\u2019s like, Canada had the commission and still the government isn't taking responsibility. Here in the U.S. we\u2019re further behind,\u201d McCleave said, adding that she was disappointed to learn that Canada had previously denied requests to fund searches for residential school burial sites, and instead, communities have had to pursue investigations themselves.\n\n\u201cIn America, we have zero policies, really, that are anywhere close to what Canada has done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe political divide here isn\u2019t helping anything. So much divide in politics, so the whole arena right now is looking pretty bleak.\u201d",

            "content": "Pope Francis has said he was pained by the discovery of the remains of 215 children at a former Catholic school for indigenous students in Canada and called for respect of the rights and cultures of native peoples, but stopped short of the direct apology some Canadians had demanded.\n\nSpeaking to pilgrims and tourists in St Peter\u2019s Square in the Vatican during his weekly blessing, Francis urged Canadian political and Catholic religious leaders to \u201ccooperate with determination\u201d to shed light on the finding and to seek reconciliation and healing.\n\nFrancis said he felt close to \u201cthe Canadian people, who have been traumatised by the shocking news\u201d.\n\nTwo days ago, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the Catholic church must take responsibility for its role in running many of the schools.\n\nThe residential schools operated between 1831 and 1996 and were run by a number of Christian denominations on behalf of the government. Most were run by the Catholic church. The Canadian government has admitted physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nThe discovery last month of the remains of the children at the Kamloops Indian Residential school in British Columbia, which closed in 1978, has reopened old wounds and is fuelling outrage in Canada about the lack of information and accountability.\n\nChief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia has said her nation wants a public apology from the Catholic church. The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which ran nearly half of Canada\u2019s residential schools, has yet to release any records about the Kamloops school, she said.\n\n\u201cThe sad discovery further increases the understanding of the pain and suffering of the past,\u201d Francis said.\n\n\u201cThese difficult moments represent a strong reminder for all of us to distance ourselves from the model of coloniser \u2026 and to walk side by side in dialogue and in mutual respect in the recognition of the rights and cultural values of all the sons and daughters of Canada.\u201d\n\nThe residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 children from their homes. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition in what the truth and reconciliation commission in 2015 called \u201ccultural genocide\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet us commend to the Lord the souls of all of the dead children in the residential schools of Canada and let us pray for the families and the native communities of Canada shattered by pain,\u201d he said before asking the crowd to join him in silent prayer.\n\nFrancis, who was elected pope 17 years after the last schools was closed, has already apologised for the church\u2019s role in colonialism in the Americas.\n\nBut he has mostly chosen to make direct apologies while visiting countries and talking to native peoples. No papal visit to Canada is scheduled.\n\nVisiting Bolivia in 2015, Francis apologised for the \u201cmany grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God\u201d.",

            "content": "First Nations people across Australia are mourning with Canadian First Nations families as evidence mounts of hundreds of deaths of children at residential schools.\n\nWe are standing with our Canadian First Nations brothers and sisters on these recent horrific discoveries.\n\nThe massacres, forced assimilation and cultural genocide in Australia is something this country has yet to face up to. My own experience of being removed from my family and taken thousands of kilometres away to a mission home is part of that history.\n\nThe massacres, removal of children, poisonings and atrocities inflicted on Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples were designed to exterminate us, to erase the entire race of my people on this planet.\n\nI think about the day I was taken every day. The process was a continuing act of colonisation and assimilation and the aims of it was akin to being buried alive. That is how I feel every day.\n\nLast week it was announced that more than 700 unmarked graves had been discovered by the Cowessess First Nation at the Marieval Indian residential school in Saskatchewan province.\n\nAdded to the recent 215 graves discovered by the Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation at the former Kamloops Indian residential school in British Columbia last month, and further graves on other sites, the number of graves is more than 1,000.\n\nFrom colonisation, many First Nations in Canada lost their lands, and from the late 1800s, First Nations children in many parts of Canada were forced to attend residential schools distant from their families as part of an assimilation policy.\n\nFrequently the schools were run by religious orders connected with Christian churches. They forbade children speaking in their First Nations languages and other cultural practices, often through violence. Many children suffered abuse, including deprivation of food, physical violence and sexual abuse.\n\nThe experiences in Canada are echoed here in Australia. Until there is truth-telling in Australia about the colonisation process across the whole of the continent, the process of reconciliation remains superficial. The country and its political leadership needs to address these issues as a matter of urgency.\n\nIt is also a responsibility to call out the Australian government and say: you are guilty of the same reticence to do anything to support generations with the suffering of their past.\n\nOpen your eyes, your heart, and your chance to change how we treat each other, and how we treat our First Nations people, and honour our history, our truth.\n\nAs an Arrernte Elder, I and my family and community have a strong obligation to stand together in times of discoveries like these. To stand in solidarity, in truth telling, in solemnity, and mark the time this situation occurred.\n\nIt was the aspiration of the assimilation policy and programs to allow us to die a thousand deaths every day. Telling my story every time is perpetual grief. There is no respite. There is no relief. There is no respect, and no recompense.\n\u2022 None William Pengarte Tilmouth is an Arrernte Elder and chair of Children\u2019s Ground",

            "content": "OTTAWA, June 4 (Reuters) - The Catholic Church must take responsibility for its role in running many of Canada\u2019s residential schools for indigenous children, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, after the discovery of the remains of 215 children at one former school last month.\n\n\"As a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,\" Trudeau told reporters. \"We expect the Church to step up and take responsibility for its role in this.\"\n\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBetween 1831 and 1996, Canada's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 children from their homes. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called \"cultural genocide\".\n\nRun by the government and church groups - the majority of them Catholic - the schools' stated aim was to assimilate indigenous children.\n\nThe discovery this week of the remains of the children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, which closed in 1978, has reopened old wounds and is fueling outrage about a persistent lack of information and accountability.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1969, a Catholic congregation called the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate ran the Kamloops school, which was once Canada's largest.\n\nOn Friday, Tk\u0313eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc Chief Rosanne Casimir, on whose land the Kamloops school still stands, told reporters the nation has not received any records from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate that would help identify the children.\n\n\"We do want an apology\" from the Catholic Church, Casimir said. \"A public apology. Not just for us, but for the world.\"\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologized for the system. Trudeau said many are \"wondering why the Catholic Church in Canada is silent, is not stepping up.\"\n\nHe added: \"Before we have to start taking the Catholic Church to court, I am very hopeful that religious leaders will understand this is something they need to participate in and not hide from.\"\n\nTrudeau has not directed such pointed comments at the Catholic Church over the residential schools since taking office in 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vancouver Archbishop J. Michael Miller said on Twitter \"the Church was unquestionably wrong\" and his archdiocese would be transparent with its archives and records regarding residential schools.\n\nThe Conference said on its website that each diocese is separate and responsible for its own actions.\n\n\"The Catholic Church as a whole in Canada was not associated with the residential schools, nor was the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops,\" it said.\n\nSeparately, United Nations human rights experts on Friday called on both Canada and the Vatican to further investigate the deaths of the children found in Kamloops.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Canada and the Holy See would leave such heinous crimes unaccounted for and without full redress,\u201d they said in a statement.",

            "content": "A Canadian Indigenous group said Wednesday that a search using ground-penetrating radar has found 182 human remains in unmarked graves at a site near a former Catholic Church-run residential school that housed Indigenous children taken from their families.\n\nThe latest discovery of graves near Cranbrook, British Columbia, follows reports of similar findings at two other such church-run schools, one of more than 600 unmarked graves and another of 215 bodies. Cranbrook is 524 miles east of Vancouver.\n\nThe Lower Kootenay Band said in a news release that it began using the technology last year to search the site close to the former St. Eugene's Mission School, which was operated by the Catholic Church from 1912 until the early 1970s. It said the search found the remains in unmarked graves, some about 3 feet deep.\n\nIt's believed the remains are those of people from the bands of the Ktunaxa nation, which includes the Lower Kootenay Band, and other neighboring First Nation communities.\n\nChief Jason Louie of the Lower Kootenay Band, which is also a member of the Ktunaxa Nation, called the discovery \"deeply personal\" since he had relatives attend the school.\n\n\"Let's call this for what it is,\" Louie told CBC radio in an interview. \"It's a mass murder of Indigenous people.\"\n\n\"The Nazis were held accountable for their war crimes. I see no difference in locating the priests and nuns and the brothers who are responsible for this mass murder to be held accountable for their part in this attempt of genocide of an Indigenous people.\"\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Thousands of children died there of disease and other causes, with many never returned to their families.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which today is the largest Protestant denomination in the country.\n\nThe Canadian government has acknowledged that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nLast week, the Cowessess First Nation, located about 85 miles east of the Saskatchewan capital of Regina, said investigators found \"at least 600\" unmarked graves at the site of a former Marieval Indian Residential School.\n\nLast month, the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were found buried on the site of what was once Canada's largest Indigenous residential school near Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nPrior to news of the most recent finding, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he has asked that the national flag on the Peace Tower remain at half-mast for Canada Day on Thursday to honor the Indigenous children who died in residential schools.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that a group of Indigenous leaders will visit the Vatican later this year to press for a papal apology for the Roman Catholic Church's role in residential schools.\n\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops said Indigenous leaders will visit the Vatican between December 17 and 20 to meet with Pope Francis and \"foster meaningful encounters of dialogue and healing.\"\n\nAfter the graves were found in Kamloops, the pope expressed his pain over the discovery and pressed religious and political authorities to shed light on \"this sad affair.\" But he didn't offer the apology sought by First Nations and the Canadian government.\n\nLouie said he wants more concrete action than apologies.\n\n\"I'm really done with the government and churches saying they are sorry,\" he said. \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\"\n\nThe Canadian government formally apologized for the policy and abuses in 2008. In addition, the Presbyterian, Anglican and United churches have apologized for their roles in the abuse.\n\nA papal apology was one of 94 recommendations from Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but the Canadian bishops conference said in 2018 that the pope could not personally apologize for the residential schools.\n\nSince the discovery of unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools, there have been several fires at churches across Canada. There has also been some vandalism targeting churches and statues in cities.\n\nFour small Catholic churches on Indigenous lands in rural southern British Columbia have been destroyed by suspicious fires and a vacant former Anglican church in northwestern B.C. was recently damaged in what RCMP said could be arson.\n\nOn Wednesday, Alberta's premier condemned what he calls \"arson attacks at Christian churches\" after a historic parish was destroyed in a fire.\n\n\"Today in Morinville, l'\u00e9glise de Saint-Jean-Baptiste was destroyed in what appears to have been a criminal act of arson,\" Kenney said in a statement.\n\nRCMP said officers were called to the suspicious blaze at St. John Baptiste Parish in Morinville, about 40 kilometers north of Edmonton, in the early hours of Wednesday.",

            "content": "RENO, Nev. \u2013 The Stewart Indian School in Carson City may come under federal review following U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's announcement that the government will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nLast month, Haaland, who is a member of New Mexico\u2019s Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, outlined the national initiative while addressing members of the National Congress of American Indians during its midyear conference.\n\nThe initiative stemmed from the discovery of a mass grave containing the remains of 215 children, all uncovered on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school. The Kamloops Indian Residential School is one of many institutions that held Indigenous children taken from families across the nation and in the United States.\n\nThe Nevada school housed thousands of students during its 90 years of operations, and local tribe members recall family members who repeatedly ran away from the school after being forcibly cut off from their families, culture and languages.\n\nThe Nevada Indian Commission has been collecting information on the history of the former Stewart Indian School, said the commission's executive director, Stacey Montooth.\n\nMontooth said the Nevada Indian Commission has not yet received direction from the U.S. Department of Interior. Still, the state agency is \u201ccommitted to following the lead of our alumni and our tribal leaders on how they want to pursue outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nMass grave of 215 children in Canada:A stark reminder of the dark history of Native American boarding schools in US\n\nMarieval Indian Residential School:Groups report discovery of 751 bodies at Indigenous school in Saskatchewan\n\n\u201cThe news that has grabbed the world\u2019s attention about the findings in Canada at their residential school, it\u2019s not surprising to Native American people,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cBut the lack of surprise doesn\u2019t make this any easier to deal with.\u201d\n\nHaaland previously said the investigation will help \u201cuncover the truth about the loss of human life and lasting consequences of the institutions.\"\n\nThe unprecedented initiative will include compiling and reviewing decades of records to locate past boarding schools, unearth known and possible burial sites at or near those schools, and identify the students\u2019 names and tribal affiliations.\n\nEarlier this week, Montooth spoke with other tribal leaders from other parts of the country who have been working to identify missing students from boarding schools.\n\nThe discovery in Canada prompted a national discussion about atrocities against Native American communities in the U.S., Montooth said.\n\nA look back at the Stewart Indian School\n\nThe Stewart Indian School opened Dec. 17, 1890, shortly after the first Indian boarding school in the country was established in Pennsylvania. It initially had three teachers and 37 students from the local Washoe, Paiute and Shoshone tribes. The school sat 3 miles southeast of Carson City and encompassed 240 acres.\n\nMontooth said the U.S. waged wars against Native American communities following a failed treaty period.\n\n\u201cThey basically tried to kill all of the Indians, and that didn\u2019t work,\" she said\n\nThe next approach involved assimilation. Montooth said the school, which stayed open for 90 years, was operated like a military academy, with the goal of assimilation.\n\nThe campus opened with a capacity for 100 students. It included a Victorian-style wood-framed dormitory and schoolhouse. As enrollment increased, new buildings were added to including a place for training, a recreation room and a hospital.\n\nAccording to the cultural center\u2019s website, a railroad stop was established in 1906 to deliver supplies and transport students to and from the school. By 1919, 400 students attended the school. Vocational training remained the school\u2019s focus until it shifted to academics in the late 1960s.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, we would call that kidnapping,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cFederal representatives of the government would physically, harshly take children and rip them from their mothers\u2019 arms and bring them to boarding schools where they were beaten for speaking their language.\"\n\nShe recalled hearing a story from a local elder who described several attempts at escaping Stewart Indian School.\n\nThe woman told Montooth the school matrons cut her hair every time they brought her back to the school.\n\n\u201cHair to Native people is just absolutely sacred,\u201d Montooth said. \u201cShe said she looked like a boy because it kept getting chopped and chopped.\u201d\n\nBudget cuts and earthquake safety issues eventually forced the school\u2019s closure in 1980.\n\nThe state acquired the campus in the '90s, and it is now being used by the state for classes, training and agency offices.\n\nThe Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California founded the Stewart community on much of the former school\u2019s land, according to the cultural center\u2019s website.\n\nMeanwhile, the school has since been listed on the National Registrar of Historic Places. The cultural center and museum is in the former administration building.",

            "description": "Survivor of school where remains of 215 Indigenous children were found recounts abuse: \"We were told we were ugly\"  CBS News",
            "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is apologizing to Indigenous Canadians after the remains of more than 200 Indigenous children were found last week.\n\n\"Saying sorry for the tragedies of the past is not enough, is not enough for the children who died, for the families or for the survivors and communities,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe remains were discovered in Kamloops, British Columbia, at what was once Canada's largest school for Indigenous children. Some of the victims were as young as three.\n\nThe Kamloops Indian Residential School used to have at least 51 confirmed deaths on its official record. Garry Gottfriedson, a survivor of the school, told CBS News' Jericka Duncan that he wasn't surprised to find out at least 215 more students were found buried there.\n\n\"Sometimes kids would not show up in classroom, they would disappear for the next day and we knew that they were gone, but we didn't know where they were gone,\" Gottfriedson said.\n\nHe's among the thousands of Indigenous people legally mandated by the Canadian government to attend so-called \"residential schools.\" They were set up in the late 19th century and often operated by the Catholic church. The last one closed in 1997.\n\nCrystal Gayle Fraser, a University of Alberta professor, said abuse was rampant at these schools.\n\n\"The whole point was to erase their Indigenous identities. These Indian residential schools have often been compared to prisons,\" Fraser said.\n\nGottfriedson recalled some of the abuse, including times where he said he and others were forced not to speak their native language.\n\n\"We were never allowed to speak our languages in there. Because of fear of punishment, so those of us that were little were absolutely terrified,\" he said.\n\nA Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to investigate abuse at the schools. In 2015 it issued a report saying the government committed \"cultural genocide.\" At least 4,000 students died at these schools of disease, neglect, accidents or abuse.\n\nThe Canadian government has paid more than $1.6 billion to survivors of these schools. The commission recommended \"94 calls to action\" to help the country address its past treatment of Indigenous children.\n\nThe heinous discovery happened after a group of Indigenous peoples used radar technology on the ground near the school. But Fraser said the abuse has long been known.\n\n\"Indigenous communities and families have been saying these things for decades, often not notified of deaths. Their children never return home, unable to get any sorts of answers,\" she said.\n\nIndigenous communities are calling for other school sites to also be searched for remains of school children.\n\nIn a statement, the group's chief wrote that \"the true accounting of the missing students will hopefully bring some peace and closure to those lives lost.\"\n\nBut for Gottfriedson, his time at the Kamloops Indian Residential School still haunts him.\n\n\"We were made to feel ugly because we were told we were ugly. We were made to feel like we were nothing but dirt, and that has remained with me to this very, very day is it's you know, I've never felt that I was good enough for anything,\" he said.",

            "content": "A mayor in Canada wants to tax the Catholic Church as a result of its role in Canada\u2019s assimilative residential school system\u2014a role currently in the spotlight as more unmarked gravesites at former Catholic-run residential schools are confirmed across the country.\n\n\u201cBecause of the gruesome past and terrifying future we are waiting to see... Because (the Catholic Church is) refusing to apologize, I want to remove their tax exemption,\u201d Bell told CTV News. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for other politicians and other cities to do the exact same thing.\u201d\n\nCalls are mounting for the Catholic Church to be taxed or to hand over money to help Indigenous communities heal after the federal government and churches spent more than a century forcibly assimilating 150,000 First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit children in residential schools across Canada and the U.S.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church hasn\u2019t disclosed its net worth. But there\u2019s no doubt it is one of the richest institutions on the planet, considering it\u2019s one of the largest landowners in the world, and enjoys significant investments, and coffers full of gold and priceless original art. The Vatican, which is just a fraction of the Church, is worth $4 billion.\n\nSince May, more than 1,000 unmarked graves have been confirmed at former residential schools, with the first 215 reported by a First Nation in British Columbia. Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation said most of the remains were likely of children, some as young as 3, and the news triggered nationwide mourning, searches for more sites just like it, and unprecedented mainstream attention paid to Canada\u2019s horrific colonial history and its ongoing legacy.\n\nMore than half of residential schools were run by Catholics. Sweeping abuses were common, and children were routinely punished for speaking their languages and expressing their cultures. Malnutrition and disease were also widespread, and thousands of children were killed.\n\nIn Canada, churches and religious groups enjoy similar tax exemptions to charities for providing a public good. But as Alberta Views Magazine reported, churches don\u2019t need to hit the same standards the many charities and nonprofits do\u2014churches, by nature, can discriminate based on religion. The magazine estimates that Alberta alone misses out on millions of dollars of revenue every year because of the exemptions.\n\n\"The Roman Catholic Church is filthy rich but they're hesitant to do the right thing,\" a residential school survivor who lives near the cathedral told CBC. \"It's not for us. Help the future generations who are paying the price.\"\n\n\u201cThey were asked to pay $25 million to Indigenous people, which is not a lot of money in global terms, and they never paid it,\u201d Coren said. \u201cIf you're not going to pay what is being estimated then there should be some sort of consequence to that.\u201d\n\nCoren admitted that if and when governments increase taxes on places of worship, it may make it more difficult for smaller, community-centred spots that help newcomers, fight food insecurity and homelessness, to serve their communities, and that it would also likely apply to all denominations and religions. But given the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201csize and wealth,\u201d they have to address the issues \u201cnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that one religion is singled out for school funding. In Ontario, with changing demographics, what about Muslim parents, Jewish parents, reform Protestant?\u201d Coren said, adding that there is precedent for provinces to stop funding Catholic schools. Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador stopped funding Catholic schools in 1997.",

            "content": "Ground-penetrating radar found the children\u2019s bodies that the survivors of Canada\u2019s \u201cresidential schools\u201d always knew were there. For more than a century, these schools functioned as re-education camps run by the Canadian government and Catholic church to assimilate Indigenous children. Children were raped, locked in chicken coops, shocked in an electric chair, subject to medical experiments, confined by electric fences and all too often dug the graves of other children who were buried in unmarked graves. This happened under the cover of the Bible, while the Canadian government promoted itself as a bastion of human rights.\n\nMore than 1,000 unmarked children\u2019s graves have been discovered at former residential schools. Why was the truth buried for so long? The answer lies in the weaponisation of history. In his presidential address to the Royal Society of Canada in 1922, Duncan Campbell Scott, the Canadian civil servant who ran the residential schools at their peak between 1913 and 1932, noted that historians had a \u201cduty and obligation to accept no statement without documentary evidence\u201d. For years, the Canadian government mounted a potent colonial propaganda campaign that was abetted by the churches to cover up wrongdoing. Leading perpetrators in the residential school scandal were exalted in history books while statues of them were erected in prominent places. Meanwhile, Indigenous peoples were dehumanised, ensuring that any leaked reports or evidence of wrongdoing would receive little attention.\n\nThe Canadian government is now doubling down on the narrative that the residential schools are part of its \u201cdark history\u201d. This detracts from ongoing injustices in the present day, such as its litigation against First Nations children and residential school survivors in court. The Catholic church has sent prayers, but has refused to issue a papal apology or make proper financial reparations to survivors and disclose residential school records.\n\nFor years, the Canadian government promoted the myth that \u201cpeople back then did not know better\u201d. Yet there were whistleblowers who had attempted to raise the alarm. In the same year that Scott gave his address to the Royal Society of Canada, the public health physician Peter Bryce published The Story of A National Crime, a report detailing Scott\u2019s stonewalling of public health measures in residential schools, where child death rates were 25% a year. Bryce had been raising the alarm since 1907, when his first report linking inequalities in Indian public health and terrible health practices in residential schools to prolific death rates was leaked to the newspapers.\n\nBryce refused to stay silent, despite the efforts of the church and the Canadian government to discredit him. So the government erased Bryce and others like him from history, ensuring there was no mention of Bryce or his report in school curriculum. He was buried in Canada\u2019s national Beechwood cemetery; for decades, only his family visited his grave.\n\nBryce was not the only whistleblower. Children in the \u201cschools\u201d pleaded for help too. A 1923 letter written by little Edward B to his parents said the boys in the schools were so hungry that they were eating cats and wheat. His letter found its way to Scott, who responded that \u201c99% of the children in the schools were too fat anyway\u201d.\n\nScott was initially acclaimed by the government of Canada as a loyal public servant and confederate poet. But as the children who survived the residential schools summoned the strength to tell their truths, Bryce\u2019s report resurfaced alongside the reports of hundreds of other whistleblowers. Scott\u2019s image was slowly tarnished, but the rust only set in when the children\u2019s bodies were found. In fact, until just a few weeks ago, the government of Canada website listed Scott as a \u201cPerson of National Significance\u201d for being an \u201cadvocate for education\u201d. This is despite the fact that Scott himself admitted that \u201c50% of the children who passed through these schools did not live to benefit from the education which they had received therein\u201d.\n\nAs historians try to educate Canadians and peel back the colonial propaganda that allowed the truth of Canada\u2019s residential schools to go unexamined for so long, others are taking matters into their own hands by burning churches and removing colonial statues. In 2015, after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released its final report documenting the horrors of the \u201cschools,\u201d a plaque was unveiled beside Bryce\u2019s gravesite in Beechwood Cemetery. Duncan Campbell Scott is buried there too; a year later a historical plaque with the phrases \u201cconfederate poet\u201d and \u201ccultural genocide\u201d was revealed. The aim of these plaques is to give proper weight to the historical legacies of these individuals. The historical research behind the plaques informed the school curriculum, and now Bryce\u2019s grave is one of the most visited in Beechwood.\n\nIn 2013, Bryce was mentioned in legal proceedings against the Canadian government for discriminatory underfunding of First Nations children\u2019s public services. In 2016, a legal ruling was issued ordering the government to cease its discriminatory conduct Government ministers welcomed the decision but have done little to fix the problem. It has taken 19 further orders and counting to get Canada closer to ending the inequities in First Nations children\u2019s public services that Bryce pointed to 114 years ago. But the people who were unheard are now coming forward. It\u2019s long past time to listen, make reparations and end the injustices and propaganda that led to the deaths of so many young children.\n\u2022 None Cindy Blackstock, a member of the Gitxsan First Nation, is the executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and professor at McGill University.

This detracts from ongoing injustices in the present day, such as its litigation against First Nations children and residential school survivors in court. In the same year that Scott gave his address to the Royal Society of Canada, the public health physician Peter Bryce published The Story of A National Crime, a report detailing Scott\u2019s stonewalling of public health measures in residential schools, where child death rates were 25% a year. Bryce had been raising the alarm since 1907, when his first report linking inequalities in Indian public health and terrible health practices in residential schools to prolific death rates was leaked to the newspapers.",

            "content": "KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) \u2014 The remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, have been found buried on the site of what was once Canada's largest Indigenous residential school \u2014 one of the institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.\n\nA report more than five years ago by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission said at least 3,200 children had died amid abuse and neglect, and it said it had reports of at least 51 deaths at the Kamloops school alone between 1915 and 1963.\n\nThe band is still working with a radar specialist to complete a survey of the ground. They anticipate having a full report ready by mid-June \u2014 one Casimir said will be shared publicly, but not until it has been disclosed to its membership and other local First Nations chiefs.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,\u201d Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.",

From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They anticipate having a full report ready by mid-June \u2014 one Casimir said will be shared publicly, but not until it has been disclosed to its membership and other local First Nations chiefs. \n\n\u201cGiven the size of the school, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time, we understand that this confirmed loss affects First Nations communities across British Columbia and beyond,\u201d Casimir said in the initial release issued late Thursday.",

We got married there, our children grew up there.\u201d\n\nBishop Mina, bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Mississauga, Vancouver and Western Canada, called on British Columbia premier John Horgan to conduct an investigation.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this fire\u2026raises many questions about what the authorities did to protect our church, especially considering the attempt on the same church this past Wednesday,\u201d Mina said.\n\nThe burnings, along with acts of vandalism against various churches, began following the discoveries of unmarked graves at former schools for indigenous Canadians run by churches. Around 150,00 children attended the \u201cIndian residential school system\u201d over 120 years, and a Canadian commission concluded in 2015 that the school system perpetrated a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d against the indigenous population.\n\nSend a tip to the news team at NR.",

Bishop Mina, bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Mississauga, Vancouver and Western Canada, called on British Columbia premier John Horgan to conduct an investigation. \n\nThe burnings, along with acts of vandalism against various churches, began following the discoveries of unmarked graves at former schools for indigenous Canadians run by churches.",

            "content": "David\u2019s death is horrifying and outrageous, not just because of the inhumane facts of the case but because the executive branch, which includes DCF and the Office of the Child Advocate, and the Legislature risk failing to meet the moment. As legislators with responsibilities for public policy and DCF\u2019s more than $1.1 billion budget, and as human beings, we must hold ourselves \u2014 and our institutions \u2014 accountable and take real action to prevent more child fatalities.\n\n\u201cThe child protective system has many built-in safeguards, both internal and external to the Department of Children and Families. All of these safeguards failed David and resulted in his untimely death,\u201d read the Office of the Child Advocate\u2019s investigative report into the death of 14-year-old David Almond , an adolescent with autism who died in the care and custody of DCF on Oct. 21, 2020.\n\nHere is what we know about David Almond\u2019s case: At the time of his death, David, at 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighed a mere 80 pounds, having lost 60 pounds in seven months. He had bruises on his wrists and ankles, multiple scrapes, and fentanyl in his system, according to medical reports. He was starved, tortured, beaten, drugged, and died. His brother Michael (also 14, they were two of a set of triplets) was emaciated and critically ill.\n\nDavid was removed by DCF from a residential school in March 2020 and sent with Michael to live with his biological father, who had been deemed unfit to care for triplets by the Juvenile Court. The third brother, referred to as Noah in the report, refused to leave the residential school. In the approximately seven months that he resided with his father and was still in the custody of the state, DCF did not conduct a single in-person visit, and the Fall River schools never saw or spoke with him. DCF performed two perfunctory foster care reviews, where neither parent attended, and yet the review of the situation was inexplicably found satisfactory.\n\nThe House of Representatives acted swiftly and unanimously, in July 2020, to vote for \u201cAn Act Relative to Accountability for Vulnerable Children and Families.\u201d In January 2021, on the last night of formal session, the House voted on an amended version of the legislation. In March 2021, in the earliest portion of a new session, once more the House acted alone in passing what is now H.88. In all its iterations, this bill would require, among many things, an updated reunification review polices and improved policies for collateral checks and case transfers. It would also require:\n\n\u25aa A measure of the impacts of COVID-19, including reports on the use of virtual services by DCF.\n\n\u25aa Updates to DCF reporting requirements in general and specifically on COVID-related policies and data.\n\nAs reports of abuse and neglect across our Commonwealth plummeted with the closure of in-person learning and doctor visits, DCF did not maintain consistent tracking or records on the use of virtual or video services. In the case of David Almond, the DCF case management team conducted monthly virtual home visits with the family. At no point did DCF do an in-person visit or speak to the children alone.\n\nDCF leadership have not answered the questions related to the decision by the Fall River Area Office management to push for reunification. They have not answered the questions about the evaluation of David\u2019s health and safety while residing with this father and his girlfriend. David\u2019s case was never even identified as high risk.\n\nThe use of virtual and video services is new due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but other factors in this case are not. Jeremiah Oliver and Bella Bond, whose names are burned in our collective memory, died in the care and custody of DCF. The people of our Commonwealth were shocked, horrified, and demanded action. Lyric Farrell, a DCF-involved toddler, died in December 2019. Lyric\u2019s death was shrouded in secrecy, and we are now similarly fighting to bring attention to David Almond\u2019s death.\n\nWe must act now and pass the reforms as drafted in the House bill as an immediate, focused, and proactive effort to improve child welfare outcomes in Massachusetts. This legislation and implementation is urgent. The Joint Committee on Children, Families, and Persons with Disabilities, with new chairs Representative Mike Finn and Senator Adam Gomez, must evaluate the recently issued 106-page report with its more than 30 recommendations to move on to the additional issues to be addressed within DCF and among the many stakeholders.\n\nWe must meet this moment with what we can do now and move with momentum to what we must do soon. Every moment in the life of a child matters.",

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio\n\nOTTAWA, July 1 (Reuters) - Multiple cities scrapped Canada Day celebrations on Thursday after the discovery of hundreds of remains of children in unmarked graves at former indigenous schools sparked a reckoning with the country's colonial past.\n\nCalls to scale back or cancel celebrations snowballed after, beginning in May, almost 1,000 unmarked graves were found at former residential schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan that were mainly run by the Catholic Church and funded by the government.\n\nTraditionally the holiday is celebrated with backyard barbecues and fireworks much like July 4 in the United States. This year, however, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the day would be \"a time for reflection.\" read more\n\nA #CancelCanadaDay march in Canada's capital, Ottawa, turned into a sea of orange as thousands rallied wearing orange shirts to honor the victims and survivors of Canada's residential school system. They carried a large banner that read, \"No pride in genocide.\"\n\nThe residential schools forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nHundreds of people, likewise in orange shirts, also marched through downtown Toronto, Canada's financial capital, in support of the indigenous children. Indigenous performer Danielle Migwans performed a healing dance during the march.\n\nOrange has come to symbolize the acknowledgment of the victims of the country\u2019s residential school system.\n\nVigils and rallies were held across other parts of the country.\n\n\"Canada is having a reckoning with its history,\" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a University of Toronto sociology professor who studies race, crime and criminal justice.\n\n\"I don't think we can celebrate this country for what it is without recognizing this country for what it isn't: a utopia and a bastion of equality and freedom and equal opportunity for all members of society,\" he said.\n\nCanada's reputation for tolerance was built on its efforts, starting in the 1970s, to create a multicultural society. But data shows inequalities abound both for indigenous communities and among visible minorities.\n\nIn his Canada Day message, Trudeau said the discoveries of the remains of hundreds of children at former residential schools \"have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures,\" and the injustices that still exist for indigenous peoples and many others in Canada.\n\n\"This Canada Day, let's recommit to learning from and listening to each other so we can break down the barriers that divide us, rectify the injustices of our past, and build a more fair and equitable society for everyone.\"\n\nIndigenous people, who make up less than 5% of the population, face higher levels of poverty and violence and shorter life expectancies.\n\nThe unemployment rate for visible minorities, who make up more than 20% of the total population, was 11.4% in May compared with 7.0% for whites, according to Statistics Canada. In 2020, the unemployment rate for indigenous people in Ontario was 12.5%, compared with 9.5% for non-indigenous people.\n\nSome 30% of visible minorities and indigenous peoples feel treated like outsiders in their own country, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll on diversity and racism published on June 21.\n\nThe discovery of the remains and a deadly attack on a Muslim family in June that killed three generations of members has led to soul-searching in Canada about the country's oft-touted reputation for tolerance. The suspect is accused of murder and domestic terrorism. read more\n\nHate crimes against Muslims rose 9% to 181 in 2019, according to the latest data by StatCan. About 36% of indigenous people and 42% of visible minorities said Canada is a racist country, according to the Angus Reid survey.\n\nA number of Muslim women who wear hijabs have also been attacked in Alberta in recent weeks, while in Quebec a law banning public servants from wearing the hijab is facing legal challenges, and critics have called the measure a form of institutionalized racism.\n\nNew Democrat lawmaker Mumilaaq Qaqqaq, who is Inuk, said she felt unsafe in the House of Commons as an indigenous woman, and last month announced she would not run for re-election. read more\n\n\"I don't think there's any reason for celebration (on Canada Day),\" Qaqqaq said.\n\nReporting by Steve Scherer, additional reporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Dan Grebler",

Indigenous communities are necessarily close-knit, and we live in the histories of our people despite every effort at the eradication of our knowledges, cultures, languages \u2013 and of our lives.\n\nPublished in 2015, the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) estimated that 4,100 named and unnamed students died in Canada\u2019s residential schools. To keep costs low, the report said, many were probably buried in untended and unmarked graves at school cemeteries, rather than sending the students\u2019 bodies back to their home communities. Often, parents were not notified at all, or the children were said to have died from sickness \u2013 an excuse commonly used to justify intentional genocides of Indigenous nations, predicated on our supposed biological inferiority.\n\nMy reserve community is Thunderchild First Nation, Saskatchewan, in the middle of the beautiful northern prairies. The institution intended for children from Thunderchild was called St Henri, built in 1901 by the Roman Catholic church. The creation of these residential schooling institutions was a direct result of Canadian policy aiming to remove Indigenous people from our lands and assimilate us into Canadian society. Neither the church nor the state is innocent in the continued genocide of our people.\n\nOn 27 May 2021, the graves of at least 215 Native children were officially uncovered at the former Kamloops Indian residential school on Tk\u2019emlups te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation, in the city of Kamloops, British Columbia. Less than a month later, 751 unmarked graves were located at Marieval Indian residential school on Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan. Six days later, 182 unmarked graves were located at the site of St Eugene\u2019s mission school in Cranbrook, BC. As the days pass, more communities are unearthing such tragedies.\n\nThe outcome of this long-awaited reckoning involves multiple Native nations across the land delving into their own soils, pursuing the stories we\u2019ve all heard from our elders and knowledge-keepers.\n\nMany of us understand everyday Canadian schools themselves to be violent institutions of assimilation and colonization. In my predominantly Indigenous urban elementary school in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, I grew up singing O Canada and God Save the Queen at assemblies. In the lunchroom, Johnny Appleseed, a biblical song about a Christian god\u2019s benevolence, was to be recited before we were allowed to eat our school-provided meals. Still, the terms \u201cresidential school\u201d \u2013 and the US equivalent, \u201cboarding school\u201d \u2013 are deeply inadequate. These \u201cresidential schools\u201d, \u201cday schools\u201d, and \u201cboarding schools\u201d were prisons. These were forced labour camps.\n\nI recall hearing of Cree people, including small children, forced to work on sugar beet farms in brutal summer heat. This was a common practice from the 1940s to at least the 1980s: farmers lured dispossessed and hungry Indigenous people into seasonal labor with false promises, then forced the workers to labor 12-14 hour days with little or no pay. They slept in trucks, tents or empty grain bins. If they ventured into nearby towns, they were chased away with bats. If they tried to leave, their children might be taken away.\n\nSome of the stories we are told about residential schooling prisons involve Native children digging graves for other children. Rarely did our ancestors receive proper burials or grave markers. The soils of these lands have always known our hands, as gardeners, as workers; these lands hold our bodies and the bodies of our ancestors. The soil that lies underneath so-called Canada has been hell and it has been refuge.\n\nOne thing is clear: Native children\u2019s lives are never \u201clost\u201d; they are deliberately and violently stolen. Similarly, the lands of Indigenous people \u2013 from Canada to the US and beyond \u2013 are never \u201clost\u201d; they have been and continue to be forcibly colonized. The words we use matter for Native life because these words define the past, the present, and the possible. Reckoning with the gentle language Canadians have been taught to use to describe the violence of empire is one part of the process of undoing colonization.\n\nIn our communities, the accounting of Indigenous death feels relentless. We hear and see and feel the growing toll of graves uncovered: ever-higher numbers recited seemingly hundreds of times daily on nearly every Canadian news network. Endless repetitions of the phone numbers of Residential Schooling Crisis lines to connect the grieving with mental health counselors. None of it is enough.\n\nI refuse to play the numbers game. Our grief and our lives are not reducible to numbers or statistics. As the Twitter user @awahihte put it, \u201cKamloops is not a unit of measurement.\u201d And to whose gaze are we appealing when we repeat these numbers over and over and over, hoping to evoke empathy from a settler state that cannot feel? Meanwhile, as Indigenous people, we are struck in the heart by those numbers, every single time. There is simply no calculus that can account for the lives of each child stolen by colonialism\u2019s violence \u2013 all the moments of joy, curiosity, play and learning that make childhood such a wondrous time; these things are immeasurable and immaterial. The lived experience of Indigenous childhood is irreducible to any European notion of property, and this is precisely why it is a threat to the colonial order.\n\nAnd what can the Catholic church and the Canadian state do to repair the irreparable? The colonial institution of Canada will not reform itself, and it will certainly not end itself. Yet there is one variable often left out of this calculation: our continued resistance. I think not only about the young ones who were stolen, but the childhoods that have been reclaimed by Indigenous resurgence and the all-encompassing love of our parents and communities. Indeed, our people are still stolen and killed. Indeed, our knowledges are suppressed, and our lands are colonized. In spite of this, what allows me to wake up in the morning and feel hope is all that we managed to save \u2013 all that which they could not take. Our languages and ceremonies were preserved and practised undercover, hidden from the Indian agents patrolling our reserves. And parents camped in tipis outside those prisons, waiting to see their children. They never gave up. Nor will we.\n\nThe institution for children at my reserve, Thunderchild First Nation, in the middle of the beautiful northern prairies, was burned down in 1948 by a fire set in the middle of the night. The fire was rumoured to have been started by the children held in captivity at St Henri. The institution was never rebuilt.\n\nSince time immemorial, many Indigenous peoples around the world have used fire to rejuvenate the land and restore order to the natural world. The lesson is that sometimes, things must burn for the soil to heal and become healthy once more. As monuments and statues to colonial figures are toppled, and as Black and Indigenous communities continue to resist and heal, another world is becoming possible. In the next world that we are building on these lands our ancestors knew so well, no child will have their formative years violently stolen away by colonialism. They will be free. We will be free.\n\u2022 None Erica Violet Lee is n\u00eahiyaw from Saskatoon and a member of Thunderchild First Nation. She is a poet, scholar and community organizer",

            "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has asked Pope Francis to come to Canada to apologize for church-run boarding schools were hundreds of unmarked graves have now been found\n\nTORONTO -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday he has urged Pope Francis to come to Canada to apologize for church-run boarding schools where hundreds of unmarked graves have been found, and he said Canadians are \u201chorrified and ashamed\u201d by their government's longtime policy of forcing Indigenous children to attend such schools.\n\nIndigenous leaders said this week that 600 or more remains were discovered at the Marieval Indian Residential School, which operated from 1899 to 1997 in the province of Saskatchewan. Last month, some 215 remains were reported at a similar school in British Columbia.\n\nFrom the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian schools, most run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, in a campaign to assimilate them into Canadian society.\n\nIndigenous leaders have called for Pope Francis to apologize \u2014 a demand echoed again Friday by Trudeau, who said the pope should visit Canada to do it.\n\n\u201cI have spoken personally directly with His Holiness, Pope Francis, to impress upon him how important it is not just that he makes an apology but that he makes an apology to indigenous Canadians on Canadian soil\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cI know that the Catholic church leadership is looking and very actively engaged in what next steps can be taken.\u201d\n\nFollowing that discovery of the British Colombia remains, Francis expressed his pain and pressed religious and political authorities to shed light on \u201cthis sad affair.\u201d But he stopped short of a formal apology.\n\nDon Bolen, archbishop of Regina, Saskatchewan, posted a letter to the Cowessess First Nation on the archdiocese\u2019s website this week in which he repeated an apology he said he made two years ago.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the United, Presbyterian and Anglican churches, which earlier apologized for their roles in the abuse.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology in Parliament in 2008 and Canada offered billions of dollars in compensation as part of a lawsuit settlement between the government, churches and the approximately 90,000 surviving students.\n\nThe government has admitted that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages. Thousands of children died there of disease and other causes, many never returned to their families.\n\n\u201cThis was an incredibly harmful government policy that was Canada\u2019s reality for many, many decades and Canadians today are horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt was a policy that ripped kids from their homes, from their communities, from their culture and their language and forced assimilation upon them.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said many Canadians won't be able to celebrate as the country marks its birthday on July 1.\n\n\u201cCanadians across the country are waking up to something that quite frankly that Indigenous communities have long known,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cThe trauma of the past echoes very much today.\u201d\n\nIndigenous leaders have called the residential schools a system of \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d\n\nA search with ground-penetrating radar at the Marieval school resulted in 751 \u2033hits,\u2033 indicating that at least 600 bodies were buried in the area after accounting for a margin of error in the search technique, said Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess First Nation, whose lands today include the school.\n\nDelorme said the search continues and the numbers will be verified in coming weeks.\n\nHe said the gravesite is believed to hold both children and adults, and perhaps people from outside the community who attended church there.\n\nDelorme said that the individual graves had once been marked, but that the church at some point removed the markers.\n\nLast month the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3, were found buried on the site of what was once Canada\u2019s largest Indigenous residential school near Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nOn Friday, the MIssionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which operated 48 residential schools in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, including those where the bodies were recently found, said it will disclose all historical documents it has.\n\nIt said in a statement that it already has worked to make the documents available through universities, archives and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but that the work is not complete because of provincial and national privacy laws.\n\nA National Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a report in 2015 that identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools, but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Many died of tuberculosis, an illness symptomatic of the deplorable living conditions.\n\nIn the United States, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced this week that the federal government is launching an investigation into its past oversight of Native American boarding schools there. She said it will review records to identify past schools, locate burial sites and uncover the names and tribal affiliations of students.",

            "description": "What Business Leaders Can Learn From An Indigenous Worldview  Forbes",
            "content": "In May 2021, 215 Indigenous children were found buried in an unmarked grave at a Canadian residential school. This moment has catalyzed Canadians to recognize the systematic silencing and displacement of Indigenous people. It is time for all people, including business leaders, to recognize the voice and worldviews of Indigenous people worldwide.\n\nThe discovery of 215 Indigenous children buried in unmarked graves at a residential school in Canada has jolted Canadians. This tragedy is not just a concern for people living in Canada but is symptomatic of the systematic marginalization by Indigenous people worldwide.\n\nFrom the 1880s to as late as 1996, the government of Canada funded programs that forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and put them into church-run residential schools. The children were often ill-treated, and if they died, their families were either not informed or unable to bring their children\u2019s bodies home.\n\nThis treatment of Indigenous people is not exclusive to Canada\u2019s history: it is true of most nations with Indigenous populations and a colonial past, including the U.S., Australia, and South Africa.\n\nBusiness Leaders Have Much to Learn from an Indigenous Worldview\n\nWhat makes this issue tragic even beyond the appalling story it tells about maltreatment and death is that it speaks to the silencing of a worldview that could lead to better business and better societies.\n\nCurrently, the world is facing self-inflicted planetary crises, such as climate change and biodiversity loss. For example, Earth has lost 68% of its wildlife since 1970. But an Indigenous worldview assumes harmony with the land. The lands occupied by Indigenous people, who make up only 5% of the world\u2019s population, contain 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nThe principles that ground an Indigenous worldview can reshape how businesses see themselves and their relationship with the world.\n\nWhat Is an Indigenous Worldview?\n\nTo speak of a single worldview misrepresents Indigenous people as much as it would misrepresent Western businesses. There are many Indigenous worldviews, given there are many Indigenous people. However, there is an aspect of Indigenous thinking that seems to be widely held because of many Indigenous peoples\u2019 connection to the land\u2014from the Native Americans on Tribal lands to the Xhosa of southern Africa.\n\nSpecifically, an Indigenous worldview is relational\u2014from people to things, and even ideas. An Indigenous worldview recognizes that relationships take time to form and generate mutual responsibilities. Business is a part of the natural environment and the community: it does not sit outside of them. To speak of one automatically speaks of the other. Thus, when business harms the community or the environment, it harms itself. Earth is not just a planet: she is \u201cMother Earth,\u201d who gives to and receives from everything she holds.\n\nA relational perspective also applies to time. Past, present, and future are connected. The past and the future shape the present; the present cannot be seen out of the context of the past and future. The concerns of ancestors and future generations are equally important as the concerns of people today.\n\nBy contrast, a Western approach to business often treats people, things and activities as discrete and separated. That is, businesses are separated from each other and society, and transactions are governed by markets and contracts. Business partners negotiate what they give and receive, and value and success is governed by clocks and calendars.\n\nI asked Diane-Laure Arjali\u00e8s, an associate professor of accounting at the Ivey Business School, about her experiences working with Indigenous communities. Arjali\u00e8s is working with an array of partners to develop a Conservation Impact Bond, which is a progressive financial instrument that offers investors returns for conserving the land. A tree, she argues, has value not just when it is cut down but also when it is in the ground, because it helps to maintain biodiversity and ecological resiliency.\n\nThe most challenging part of building this new form of financial instrument is that there is no market that can value resources that remain on the land. The value therefore needs to be negotiated with the people who benefit from the conservation and the investment. These include NGOs, investors, investees, Indigenous people, and researchers.\n\nThis specific bond sought to conserve 150 acres of land in the Carolinian Life Zone in Southwestern Ontario, of which 30 acres is on the traditional territory of the Chippewas of the Thames First Nations (COTTFN). Over the last two centuries, the forest cover in the area had been reduced from 80% to 11% and wetland cover from 28% to 5%. The region is now home to more than 50% of the federally listed species at risk in Canada.\n\nEven though all the partners agreed that conservation was an important goal, they disagreed on a fundamental principle: whether land, water, and species at risk could be priced. And even if they could agree that this type of financialization helped conservation efforts, their opinions of the appropriate price were far apart. The Chippewas of the Thames First Nations saw the importance of all species, which are part of an integrated system with the land and water. One species \u2013 plant or animal \u2014 could not be priced higher than the other, as they were all mutually interdependent. Yet, an inherent principle of pricing requires pricing by value.\n\nRather than trying to simply compromise, the partners agreed on some fundamental principles, grounded in an Indigenous worldview. These included:\n\n1. Consensus-based decision-making. It was important to hear all voices and perspectives. During team meetings, everyone was encouraged to share thoughts and ideas. Much was learned not from the loudest in the room, but often from the quietest.\n\n2. Not everything that is valuable can be measured. Whereas Western approaches to business value \u2018things\u2019, the partners realized that the \u2018flows\u2019 and \u2018connections\u2019 among things were not often seen or valued. An individual species may not seem to hold much value until one sees its critical connections it makes among other species.\n\n3. The importance of storytelling. Vivid stories were often able to change hearts and minds when the numbers and data could not. Stories were able to illustrate ideas that connected people and crossed time. History and the future hold more value when they are contextualized through stories.\n\nArjali\u00e8s recalled that the process took much longer than anyone initially expected, especially with the onset of COVID-19. The partners needed time to build trust and really listen to each other. And they are still not done.\n\nYet they have landed in a place of mutual understanding and respect, and there seems to be a pathway forward. In the end, the partners are optimistic they will develop a set of principles that can truly integrate Indigenous and non-Indigenous worldviews to conserve the Earth\u2019s resources for future generations.\n\nLearning from the Past to Guide the Future\n\nMuch has been written about the harsh truths of the way that colonialists treated Indigenous peoples. Too little has been written about how much can be learned from an Indigenous worldview\u2014a worldview that can change the way business sees itself and operates in the world.\n\nFor now, sustainable development seems elusive. Yet by educating themselves about an Indigenous worldview, business executives may be able to move meaningfully towards sustainable development.\n\nThe discovery of the 215 Indigenous children is tragic. It should be a catalytic moment to awaken our senses to a community of people who honor their past by making sure it shapes their present and future. Business leaders can learn from an Indigenous worldview\u2014most of all, to work toward a desirable future not just for business, but for all.\n\nA First Step toward Learning More\n\nTo learn more, I encourage you to read about the 94 calls to action from Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including six related to the residential school systems. You may also want to acknowledge the territory on which you reside or work. This is a way to not only show respect for ancestors, but also signal your appreciation of land and community.\n\nI live and work in London, Ontario, which is on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek (Ah-nish-in-a-bek), Haudenosaunee (Ho-den-no-show-nee), L\u016bnaap\u00e9ewak (Len-ahpay- wuk) and Attawandaron (Add-a-won-da-run) peoples, on lands connected with the London Township and Sombra Treaties of 1796 and the Dish with One Spoon Covenant Wampum. For generations, these peoples have cared for their community, the land, and waters, and they continue to do so. I wish to pay my respect to their Elders and acknowledge their status as the First Nations of Turtle Island.",

            "content": "Your editorial on the atrocities against First Nations children in Canadian residential boarding schools (1 July) bore the subheading: \u201cThe discovery of hundreds of graves of Indigenous children is forcing a deeper reckoning with the country\u2019s past.\u201d\n\nI have to ask why you are fixing only on Canada\u2019s history. All of the schools where human remains have been found were set up when Canada was a British dominion within the empire. The project of illegally expropriating Indigenous lands previously guaranteed under treaty goes back at least as far as the 1783 treaty of Paris, and one can draw a direct line from that act of dispossession to the eventual formalisation of the project of genocide in the boarding schools.\n\nThe destruction of Indigenous lifeways was necessary for the British corporations whose interest in timber and other natural resources drove many of the actions of crown officials in that era, and it was British money that funded much of the early missionary work that eventually became the religious institutions that would go on to bury children in unmarked graves. Maybe a little more reckoning with the UK\u2019s own past is in order. \n\nJames Mackay \n\nAssistant professor of British and American literatures, European University Cyprus\n\nIt is so deeply important that the British press, including the Guardian, is covering the finding of unmarked graves at Canada\u2019s residential schools. I am glad to see that many of these articles are by Indigenous writers and that attention is being drawn to the various ways in which state violence against Indigenous peoples in settler colonial states continues.\n\nI have just one question: why are these things being reported as if Britain bears no responsibility? The oldest residential school in Canada \u2013 the Mohawk Institute \u2013 was established in 1831, 36 years before Canadian dominion and 48 years earlier than the Carlisle Indian industrial school in Pennsylvania, the so-called \u201cblueprint\u201d. This was British colonial policy, and it laid the foundations for all that was to come. It would be good to see this acknowledged and for pressure to be brought on the British authorities to take that history \u2013 and the ongoing obligations it establishes \u2013 seriously. \n\nDavid Stirrup \n\nProfessor of American literature and Indigenous studies, University of Kent",

I am glad to see that many of these articles are by Indigenous writers and that attention is being drawn to the various ways in which state violence against Indigenous peoples in settler colonial states continues. It would be good to see this acknowledged and for pressure to be brought on the British authorities to take that history \u2013 and the ongoing obligations it establishes \u2013 seriously. \n\nDavid Stirrup \n\nProfessor of American literature and Indigenous studies, University of Kent",

            "content": "Indigenous leaders said this week that 600 or more remains were discovered at the Marieval Indian Residential School, which operated from 1899 to 1997 in the province of Saskatchewan. Last month, some 215 remains were reported at a similar school in British Columbia.\n\nThe government has admitted that physical and sexual abuse was rampant in the schools, with students beaten for speaking their native languages. Thousands of children died there of disease and other causes, many never returned to their families.\n\n\u201cThis was an incredibly harmful government policy that was Canada\u2019s reality for many, many decades and Canadians today are horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt was a policy that ripped kids from their homes, from their communities, from their culture and their language and forced assimilation upon them.\u201d\n\nA search with ground-penetrating radar at the Marieval school resulted in 751 \u2033hits,\u2033 indicating that at least 600 bodies were buried in the area after accounting for a margin of error in the search technique, said Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess First Nation, whose lands today include the school.\n\nOn Friday, the MIssionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, which operated 48 residential schools in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, including those where the bodies were recently found, said it will disclose all historical documents it has.\n\nIt said in a statement that it already has worked to make the documents available through universities, archives and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but that the work is not complete because of provincial and national privacy laws.\n\nA National Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a report in 2015 that identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools, but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Many died of tuberculosis, an illness symptomatic of the deplorable living conditions.\n\nIn the United States, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced this week that the federal government is launching an investigation into its past oversight of Native American boarding schools there. She said it will review records to identify past schools, locate burial sites and uncover the names and tribal affiliations of students.",

            "description": "This Canada Day, let\u2019s remember: this country was built on genocide  The Guardian",
            "content": "People across the country are waking up to the reality that Canada is a country built on the violent dispossession of Indigenous peoples. The horrifying reports of unmarked graves of children at residential \u201cschools\u201d in Kamloops, British Columbia, Brandon, Manitoba, and most recently Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan have shocked many Canadians and others around the world. However, these were not discoveries, but confirmations of what we knew all along: Canada was built on genocide.\n\nIn light of this, cities and towns across the country are rethinking Canada Day. Some, like Victoria, have cancelled it outright while others, like Iqaluit, are scaling back the celebrations and treating it as a day of reflection and mourning. This is a good thing. Whether they are happening in backyard barbecues in southern Canada or in city council meetings in Nunavut, these conversations about the reality of colonization that is still at the very core of this country are long overdue.\n\nThis isn\u2019t ancient history. Nowhere is this more true than in Nunavut, the territory I represent in Canada\u2019s parliament. Until around the 1950s, Inuit lived as they had for thousands of years. Then the Canadian state expanded its presence in the north and colonized the Arctic as part of their drive for natural resources and to claim sovereignty over lands and waters. We were forced into squalid settlements, sled dogs were shot by the Mounties, and children were sent to residential schools that were meant to eradicate Indigenous culture. These joint projects of church and state were hotspots for child abuse and sexual assault carried out by priests and school administrators, most of whom have escaped justice for their crimes.\n\nFast forward 70 years. Inuit have survived. My people are resilient, strong and proud. Nunavut itself, Canada\u2019s youngest territory, was founded by survivors. They came together and forced the federal institution to recognize Inuit sovereignty. We celebrate this on 9 July, Nunavut Day, the anniversary of the Land Claims Agreement that founded our territory. The federal institution may have failed to assimilate us, but the reality is that Canada is still committing genocide in Nunavut and across the nation.\n\nWhile the last residential school closed its doors in 1996, the foster care system continues to snatch Indigenous children from their families and communities. More than 50% of children in foster care in Canada are Indigenous, but they account for less than 8% of the child population. The intergenerational trauma of colonization and the callous neglect by the federal institution means that suicide is an epidemic and women and girls go missing or are murdered at extremely high rates. As I saw on my tour of some of the poorest communities in Nunavut last summer, far too many Nunavummiut live in homes that are mouldy, overcrowded and unsafe. The cause of this crisis is simple: decades of federal underfunding and neglect.\n\nFor all his pretty words, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government have refused to put their money where their mouth is by adequately funding clean drinking water and survivable housing in Nunavut. Indigenous groups across the country are fed up with his many broken promises and symbolic gestures that mask colonial actions like fighting Indigenous children and residential school survivors in court. This is what contemporary colonization looks like: complacency in the face of Indigenous suffering and a refusal to do the bare minimum when it comes to the necessities of life.\n\nThese are the things I think of when I think of Canada Day. A history of violence that is not over. This is why I can\u2019t imagine celebrating this country until so many things change. Indigenous people can come to their own conclusions about how they mark this date, but for those of you who are settlers on these lands I am urging you to take this day to learn, to reflect and most importantly to act.\n\nBefore I was elected as an MP, I gave a speech in the House of Commons as part of a mock parliament for young women. I spoke of the toll that the suicide crisis has taken on my community and of my lost friends, classmates and teammates and asked, \u201cwhere are our non-Indigenous allies?\u201d As I ask that question again today, I see more of you and more Canadians from all walks of life waking up and showing up. This is a good shift. Indigenous peoples cannot and should not shoulder these burdens alone. They were imposed on us by Canada, and we need Canadians to play an active role in dismantling them. That means staying angry and standing alongside us to amplify our voices. Above all else, it means listening to us and actually changing things when we tell you that we are hurting.\n\nA good place to start is by getting familiar with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Qikiqtani Truth Commission. Talk to your friends and neighbours about the need for real Indigenous justice in Canada. When Indigenous groups organize protests and marches, show up and support them. And make sure your elected representatives know that they will never be re-elected if they are silent in the face of injustice. Sooner or later, when we have an election in this country, refuse to vote for political leaders who talk the talk without walking the walk. If enough people do that, maybe Indigenous peoples can have the right to self-determination, and we will have something to celebrate in this country.\n\u2022 None Mumilaaq Qaqqaq is a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing Nunavut",

            "content": "In recent weeks, over 1,000 unmarked graves for Indigenous children have been discovered at former residential schools in Canada\u2014and a wave of anger is sweeping over the nation as it confronts its dark past.\n\nOn Thursday, it was Canada Day, which is usually a day of celebration to mark the founding of the nation in the 1800s. But, this year, it was a day of protest and unrest, which saw prominent statues of the British monarchs\u2014Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II\u2014pulled from their pedestals.\n\nVideo showed protesters cheering as the Victoria statue outside the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg was dragged down. They then covered the statue\u2019s face in a Canadian flag, pelted it with balloons full of bright paint, and chanted the slogan \u201cno pride in genocide.\u201d A nearby statue of Britain's reigning queen suffered a similar fate.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the royal statues were targeted, but Victoria reigned from 1837 until her death in 1901, so was head of state at the founding of the Canadian confederation, and when the Canadian government enacted its brutal schools policy to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children.\n\nOver 150,000 Indigenous Canadian children were snatched from their families and forced to attend the schools in the 19th and 20th centuries. Canadian authorities estimate that more than 4,000 children died at the schools\u2014but some experts put the number closer to 15,000.\n\nBelinda Vandenbroeck, a residential school survivor who was at the protests, told CBC she felt no remorse over statue toppling: \u201cThis queen is the one that gave our land away just like that to her merry gentlemen\u2014her fur traders... So I really have no place for her in my heart. I never did. She means nothing to me except that her policies and her colonialism is what is dictating us right to this minute as you and I speak.\u201d\n\nOne man was reportedly shocked with a stun gun and arrested at the largely peaceful protests in Winnipeg, which were attended by thousands. Protests also took place in Toronto, and a #CancelCanadaDay march in the nation\u2019s capital of Ottawa also attracted thousands of marchers.\n\nAhead of Canada Day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that celebrations would be muted this year after the recent horrific grave discoveries.\n\nThe PM said, \u201cWe, as Canadians, must be honest with ourselves about our history because in order to chart a new and better path forward, we have to recognize the terrible mistakes of the past... The truth is we\u2019ve got a long way to go to make things right with Indigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nLast month, a Canadian First Nation tribe said it had found a mass grave with 751 bodies at a Saskatchewan boarding school, 215 bodies were found in Kamloops, and another 182 were unearthed in Cranbrook.",

            "content": "It shouldn\u2019t take a crisis to get people's attention: The outpouring of grief shared by the entire country is an extremely valid reaction, but for Indigenous people, the heartbreaking stories are a re-opening of extremely old wounds and trauma . When conversations about residential schools are everywhere, we are unable to escape from the evidence of how society has and continues to try to eradicate our cultures, our bodies, and our spirits. The Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwepemc news warranted a National Indian Residential School Crisis Line phone number accompanying most stories, (including this one) to provide emotional and crisis support. It\u2019s a start, but mental health services for and by Indigenous people are needed beyond this moment.It shouldn\u2019t take a crisis to get people's attention: Indigenous people need other Indigenous people to heal.\n\nInstead, we experience racism \u2014 in a 2020 survey of 9,000 Indigenous people from the In Plain Sight report, 84% of respondents said they experienced some form of discrimination in healthcare, which can range from the explicit, and gross, practice of emergency room care providers playing guessing games on how high the alcohol level of a patient is, to smaller microaggressions. In 2020, the racist mistreatment came to light when Joyce Echaquan livestreamed her abuse in a Joliette, Que hospital. She later died and an inquiry was launched into her death. While the coroners inquest report and its recommendations will likely take months, Coroner Gehane Kamel says her hope is that it would be the \"foundation of a new social pact that will bring us to say, 'Never again.\"\n\nAll of this recent attention to the inequalities and racism was years away when I was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety and a panic attack disorder after the birth of my son in 2014, and then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a more severe type of premenstrual syndrome. I was handed a prescription and recommendations for anxiety workbooks. Sure, the prescription and therapy definitely helped me manage my anxiety and depression, but I wasn\u2019t asked if I wanted or needed culturally appropriate health care. And medication is really just one part of a wellness plan. A culturally specific approach considers engagement in culture as good medicine.\n\n, it launched an online program called Finding Our Power Together\u2019s aim is to build on that missing link of land-based cultural healing. In 2020it launched an online program called Building Your Bundle in which staff uses an Indigenous cultural healing lens with clinical Western approaches. One example of this practice includes sending participants an actual bundle bag to carry their medicines (tobacco, sage, cedar) in. \u201cWhat we find from talking to the survivors of suicide is that a number of young Indigenous people are disconnected from who they are, their culture or their land, and that's what leads to loss of life,\u201d says Ineese-Nash. \u201cWhat we try to do is create connection \u2014 to another young person, a mentor, culture, members of their family, community, land, and spirit.\u201d She continues: \u201cFor us, it's about bringing those tools back and fostering an environment where the next generation of Indigenous leaders already know who they are and are able to pick up their bundles and support one another.\u201d",

            "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 The announcement last month that the remains of 215 Indigenous children had been found on the grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School left the nation reeling.\n\nFlags throughout Canada were put at half-staff and impromptu memorials consisting of children\u2019s moccasins or shoes, often marked with \u201c215,\u201d have sprouted, including one in front of Canada\u2019s Parliament building here.\n\n\u201cA lot of survivors, my relatives, they\u2019ve been saying this for years and years \u2014 that there was a lot of death, there\u2019s a lot of unmarked graves,\u201d said Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, the country\u2019s largest Indigenous organization, referring to children who were taken from their families and forced to attend Canada\u2019s notorious residential schools such as Kamloops to assimilate into Western culture.\n\n\u201cBut nobody ever believed the survivors,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd now with the discovery of the grave site at Kamloops, it\u2019s just horrific, it\u2019s tragic and it\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 150,000 Indigenous children passed through the schools between their opening, around 1883, and their closing in 1996. Since taking office in 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has prioritized putting in place a list of 94 actions for commemorating the students and improving the lives of Indigenous people. But Indigenous leaders believe the government still has a long way to go.\n\nThe discovery of the graves has given new impetus to the nation\u2019s debate on how to atone for its history of exploiting Indigenous people. Many are asking how so many children could have wound up in that burial space.\n\nWhat has been discovered?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, an effort to find remains started at the Kamloops school, which operated from 1890 until the late 1970s, and was once Canada\u2019s largest, with 500 students at its peak. Members of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation made last month\u2019s grim discovery after bringing in ground-penetrating radar.\n\nAmong the 215 bodies found by the radar, there appears to be one of a child who died as young as 3, said Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc. All of the children were buried decades ago, she said.\n\nCasimir also said she anticipated that more remains would be discovered as the ground is scanned further this month. The community is now working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the coroner\u2019s service in British Columbia.\n\nOn Friday, Casimir said the bodies found so far appeared to be buried in separate \u201cunmarked burial sites that are, to our knowledge, also undocumented.\u201d\n\nWhat was the residential school system?\n\nIn the late 19th century, Canada set aside land for Indigenous people through often dubious treaties, while outright seizing Indigenous land in some places, particularly in British Columbia.\n\nAround 1883, the government added a new dimension to its exploitation of Indigenous people. Indigenous children in many parts of Canada were forced to attend residential schools, often far from their communities. Most were operated by churches, and all of them banned the use of Indigenous languages and Indigenous cultural practices, often through violence. Disease and sexual, physical and emotional abuse were widespread.\n\nThe Kamloops school was operated by the Roman Catholic Church until 1969, when the federal government took over the school system. Reports by an inspector and a doctor indicated that the students at Kamloops were severely malnourished at times.\n\nA National Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up by the Canadian government spent six years hearing from 6,750 witnesses to document the history of the schools. In a report in 2015, it concluded that the system was a form of \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d\n\nThe commission also called for an apology from the pope for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s role. On Sunday, Pope Francis stopped short of offering a formal apology, but he said that \u201cthe sad discovery further raises awareness of the pains and sufferings of the past.\u201d\n\nSome former students testified before the commission that priests at the schools had fathered infants with Indigenous students and that the babies had been taken away from their young mothers and killed, in some cases their bodies thrown into furnaces.\n\nMany students also died from disease, accidents, fires and fatal attempts to escape, according to the commission.\n\nSchools suffered mass deaths when infectious diseases swept through them, according to a report this year on the burial sites by Scott Hamilton, a professor of anthropology at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay.\n\nHow many children died at the residential schools?\n\nWhen children died at residential schools, their families were often given vague explanations or told that they had simply run away and vanished, the commission found. When the schools acknowledged the deaths of children, they generally refused, until the 1960s, to return their bodies to their families. Remains were sent back only if it was cheaper than burying them at the schools.\n\nIn its report, the commission estimated that at least 4,100 students had died or gone missing from the residential schools, and it demanded that the government account for all of those children. It did not, however, definitely say how many had disappeared.\n\nMurray Sinclair, a former judge and senator who headed the commission, said in an email last week that he now believed the number was \u201cwell beyond 10,000.\u201d\n\nSince the commission ended, a federal project has been underway to document the fates of the children who never returned to their families after being sent to residential schools and now are generally known as \u201cthe missing children.\u201d\n\nRemains in unmarked graves have appeared or been discovered through construction or natural events at the sites of other former schools, although nothing on the scale of Kamloops.\n\nKisha Supernant, an Indigenous woman who directs the Institute for Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology at the University of Alberta, has been leading teams that use ground-penetrating radar and other technologies to hunt for remains.\n\nHamilton said that simply locating burial sites was often difficult because of poor record-keeping, lost records and the relocation of some schools.\n\n\u201cThese graveyards are often now unmarked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they were like 50 or 60 years ago is anyone\u2019s guess. The challenge here is that they have not been maintained. Once the schools were closed, the properties were often abandoned.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nDuring a special debate in the House of Commons on June 1, Trudeau said Canada had failed the 215 children whose remains were discovered as well as the other children who never returned to their communities from the residential schools.\n\n\u201cToday, some of the children found in Kamloops, and who have yet to be found in other places across the country, would have been grandparents or great-grandparents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not, and that is the fault of Canada.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said the government heeded calls from Indigenous leaders for money and other help to use radar and various technologies to search for the remains of students at other schools. In 2019, it budgeted 27 million Canadian dollars ($22.35 million) to look for graves. But the money was not distributed.\n\nBellegarde said he hoped the shock that followed the discovery in Kamloops would lead Canada to accelerate efforts at bringing about reconciliation and eliminating discrimination and the wide economic gap between Indigenous people and the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have to use this as this catalyst,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve helped build this great country and nobody\u2019s going anywhere. We have to work together, so let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get this work done.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

On Sunday, Pope Francis stopped short of offering a formal apology, but he said that \u201cthe sad discovery further raises awareness of the pains and sufferings of the past.\u201d\n\nSome former students testified before the commission that priests at the schools had fathered infants with Indigenous students and that the babies had been taken away from their young mothers and killed, in some cases their bodies thrown into furnaces.\n\nMany students also died from disease, accidents, fires and fatal attempts to escape, according to the commission.\n\nSchools suffered mass deaths when infectious diseases swept through them, according to a report this year on the burial sites by Scott Hamilton, a professor of anthropology at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. Since the commission ended, a federal project has been underway to document the fates of the children who never returned to their families after being sent to residential schools and now are generally known as \u201cthe missing children.\u201d\n\nRemains in unmarked graves have appeared or been discovered through construction or natural events at the sites of other former schools, although nothing on the scale of Kamloops.\n\nKisha Supernant, an Indigenous woman who directs the Institute for Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology at the University of Alberta, has been leading teams that use ground-penetrating radar and other technologies to hunt for remains.\n\nHamilton said that simply locating burial sites was often difficult because of poor record-keeping, lost records and the relocation of some schools.\n\n\u201cThese graveyards are often now unmarked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they were like 50 or 60 years ago is anyone\u2019s guess.",
