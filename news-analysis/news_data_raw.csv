However, as graves of Indigenous children were counted over the last month, Canada has made progress on four more, said Eva Jewell, associate fellow at the Yellowhead Institute, who co-authored the report, although she cautioned that it is not clear if those four have been fully implemented yet.  “Canada can summon the political will when there’s heat on them,” she told Al Jazeera.  “There’s a lot of pressure on Canada to act and to do something, and suddenly there’s been a renewed interest in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s calls to action. Meanwhile, the residential school discoveries have garnered international condemnation, including from a panel of United Nations experts who on June 4 called for “full-fledged investigations” of the grave site at Kamloops.  Murray Sinclair, the former chair of the TRC, also recently told The Globe and Mail newspaper that any investigation “should not be left in the hands of the government or the churches and must instead be created in consultation with Indigenous people”."

The federal government in 1969 took over from the Roman Catholic administration — which opened the school in the late 1800s — changed it from a school to a residence for local students until the establishment’s closure in 1978, the statement said, citing the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.   McLeod, who said he endured abuse at the school, noted that he felt “so much hurt and pain to finally hear, for the outside world, to finally hear what we assumed what was happening there.”  Many Indigenous children were forcefully separated from their families and made to attend the schools, CNN reported, citing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 2015 report, which outlined decades of abuse — physical, sexual, emotional — against children in institutions that were run by the government and church.  “We recognize the tragic, heartbreaking devastation that the Canadian residential school system has inflicted upon so many, and our thoughts are with all of those who are in mourning today"

The Canadian government, along with churches, the majority of them Catholic, ran residential schools to forcibly assimilate 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children—to “kill the Indian in the child,” a famous phrase endorsed by several residential school architects, including Canada’s first prime minister, John A.

In 2017, as Canada geared up to celebrate the country’s 150th birthday—the official celebration in Canada’s capital, Ottawa, costing upwards of $500 million—Indigenous folks all over and their allies abstained from celebrating.   Instead of Canada Day, Idle No More, an ongoing Indigenous justice movement, has announced several rallies taking place across the country to honour “all of the lives lost to the Canadian State—Indigenous lives, Black Lives, Migrant lives, Women and Trans and Two Spirit lives—all of the relatives that we have lost.”"

We need to begin to prepare ourselves for that,” Sinclair said.  Sinclair said the stories about children who died in the schools during the commission’s work was shocking and said survivors talked about children being “buried in large numbers into mass burial sites.”  The reconciliation commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school between 1915 and 1963.

At the school, Mr. Wawatay said he and other Indigenous children weren’t allowed to speak their native Algonquin language."

She continues: “For us, it's about bringing those tools back and fostering an environment where the next generation of Indigenous leaders already know who they are and are able to pick up their bundles and support one another.”"

The discovery of the graves has given new impetus to the nation’s debate on how to atone for its history of exploiting Indigenous people.   In the late 19th century, Canada set aside land for Indigenous people through often dubious treaties, while outright seizing Indigenous land in some places, particularly in British Columbia.  Around 1883, the government added a new dimension to its exploitation of Indigenous people. On Sunday, Pope Francis stopped short of offering a formal apology, but he said that “the sad discovery further raises awareness of the pains and sufferings of the past.”  Some former students testified before the commission that priests at the schools had fathered infants with Indigenous students and that the babies had been taken away from their young mothers and killed, in some cases their bodies thrown into furnaces.  Many students also died from disease, accidents, fires and fatal attempts to escape, according to the commission.  Schools suffered mass deaths when infectious diseases swept through them, according to a report this year on the burial sites by Scott Hamilton, a professor of anthropology at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. Since the commission ended, a federal project has been underway to document the fates of the children who never returned to their families after being sent to residential schools and now are generally known as “the missing children.”  Remains in unmarked graves have appeared or been discovered through construction or natural events at the sites of other former schools, although nothing on the scale of Kamloops.  Kisha Supernant, an Indigenous woman who directs the Institute for Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology at the University of Alberta, has been leading teams that use ground-penetrating radar and other technologies to hunt for remains.  Hamilton said that simply locating burial sites was often difficult because of poor record-keeping, lost records and the relocation of some schools.  “These graveyards are often now unmarked,” he said. “What they were like 50 or 60 years ago is anyone’s guess."

Trudeau called on the church to “step up” and take responsibility after years of silence.   “As a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position that the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,” Trudeau said.  “When I went to the Vatican a number of years ago I directly asked His Holiness, Pope Francis, to move forward on apologizing, on asking for forgiveness, on restitution, on making these records available, and we’re still seeing resistance from the church, possibly from the church in Canada.   Former Pope Benedict met with a group of former students and victims in 2009 and told them of his “personal anguish” over their suffering, a meeting that was termed an expression of sadness and solidarity.  The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops announced in 2018 that the pope could not personally apologize for residential schools, though he has not shied away from recognizing injustices faced by Indigenous people around the world.  The archbishop of Vancouver, however, apologized on Wednesday.
